### Foreword     
We continue to read the Book of Ezekiel this week. God looking back at Israel's history to have the prophet truthfully declare and write down their sins as warning to their descendants: God waited patiently for their never-ending rebellion. History is an accurate early warning for the people as they kept repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Even if they tried, they could not avoid repeating their past sin because of the sinful nature of human being. From Israel's history to the word that became flesh, we are able to see how God accomplishes His plan to break the chain that bonds us to sin. The people who serve God would become the ones that bring blessings to all.

May you all be renewed in God's word each day!

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The parable of two adulterous sisters to describe how Samaria and Jerusalem engaged in prostitution and strayed away from God. 

+ The Lord would stir up Oholibah's lovers, those who she turned away from in disgust, against her. 

+ Judge Oholah and Oholibah with their detestable practices. Righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood. 

+ The choice meat in cooking pot as a parable for Jerusalem. 

+ The Lord commanded Ezekiel to not lament, weep, or shed tear for the death of his wife, as a sign for Israelites that their suffering would be so great that they would have no chance to mourn for themselves. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - God cleanses us, but we must play an active role in that process. What role am I playing in the process of purify myself?
