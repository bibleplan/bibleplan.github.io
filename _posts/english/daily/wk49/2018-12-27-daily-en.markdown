What do faithful deeds wait for?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The plans of our lives should make God's will top priority. 

+ What we seek should be the valuable spiritual crop, not the worldly riches. We shall wait patiently for God's timing, be patient in suffering without swearing. 

+ We shall place God in the center of our lives, continue to pray, pray for others, and praise the Lord in all circumstances and in all things. 

+ We shall make saving the sinners from death and covering their sins as our motivation for turning them around. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God is the center of our lives. This is manifested in our pursue of valuables (5:1-12,) in our planning for the future (4:13-17,) in our attitude toward all things we face in daily life (5:13-18,) and in our motivation to preach gospel and truth (5:19-20.) Think about my conducts in these four areas, do they all come out of my faith? How my faith may be displayed in all these things?
