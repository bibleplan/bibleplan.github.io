### Question
**Why Balaam blessed Israelites when Balak wanted him to curse them?**

### Meditation: God’s Story
+ Moab wasn’t their aim when the Israelites came to camp across from Jericho. Balak summoned Balaam to curse the Israelites but God made him to bless them instead.

+ Balaam was not a prophet. He seemingly proclaimed himself a prophet was in fact a spokesperson for all false gods. He was condemned many times in Bible for his immorality, injustice, and low ethics. (Num. 31:7-8,15-16, Deu. 23:3-6; Jos. 13:22;24:9-10; Neh.13:1-3;Mic. 6:5;2 Peter 2:15-16; Jude 11; Rev. 2:14)

### Meditation: My Story
+ **Walking with God** – Why did Balaam changed places and the ways to curse the Israelites? How was God’s power shown through Balaam’s failures?

+ **Identity** – God intervened and protected Israelites when Balak summoned Balaam to curse them. God always protects without us knowing. Count the blessings I received last week from God, not from myself.
