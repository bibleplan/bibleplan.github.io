### Question     
Why is Jesus’ one sacrifice become the sacrifice for all sins forever?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ The sacrifices done in the first covenant weren’t perfect. Jesus’ sacrifice with his own blood is the eternal redemption. 

+ Only by the perfect redemption from Jesus, we may be set free from the sins committed under the first covenant. 

+ God’s plan of salvation was already written in the scriptures and can only be accomplished by His own will. 

+ Christ’s perfect offering for our sins replaces and surpasses the offerings in the first covenant. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – By Jesus Christ’s sin offering, God no longer remembers the wickedness and sins of all Christians. Am I being grateful to God’s grace? Am I living a life like Christ’s which is free from the bondage of the law?
