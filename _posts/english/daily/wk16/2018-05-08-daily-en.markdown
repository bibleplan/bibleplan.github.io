### Question
**What did Moses plead desperately to Israelites?**

{% include BibleLinks-en.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story  
+ Moses pleaded continuously to Israelites to obey God's law and pass on the obedience to their descendants so they may continue living on the promised land.

+ Moses established three cities of refuge to the east of Jordan river for the two and half tribes.

### Meditation: My Story  
+ **Walking with God** As a result of obeying God's law, `will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.` Is my head knowledge of God's law real wisdom? Do I have the law embedded deep in my heart?

+ **Walking with God** God forbids idolatry because we believe what can be seen and ignore the unseen, the truth, the way, the life. Do I believe my own eyes and what I see more than God who cannot be seen?
