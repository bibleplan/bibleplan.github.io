### Question
**What happens if one obeys God? What happens if otherwise?**

{% include BibleLinks-en.html %}

### Meditation: God?s Story  
+ God commanded Moses to chisel out of two stone tablets and make a wooden ark. God wrote the commandments on the tablets and Moses put them into the ark.

+ Moses reminded Israelites that `"God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome."` God wanted them to fear Him, to obey Him, to love Him, and to serve Him with all their hearts and souls so that they may live in His grace and blessings.

+ Moses reminded Israelites that they must observe all commands God gave them so they may be blessed.

### Meditation: My Story  
+ **Fidelity** Moses reminded the Israelites again to fix God's word on their hands, foreheads, doorframes, gates, and in their hearts and minds. Do I often read God's word in the book right next to me? Let me set a goal to strive in fixing God's word in my heart.
