### Question     
How did the Israelites cross the Jordan River to go into the land of Canaan?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God stopped the flow of Jordan River. Joshua lead the Israelites to cross the Jordan River like Moses lead their fathers to cross the Red Sea. 

+ Israelites circumcised and celebrated Passover to identify themselves as God's people. 

+ God stopped providing manna to mark the end of Israelites' wandering in the desert. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Jordan River stopped flowing to allow the Israelites to cross as soon as the ark of the covenant, which represented the presence of God, was in the Jordan River. God is with us to protect us when we walk on His path and obey His commands. Pray to God and ask for His presence in my family, workplace, school, and church to help and to lead me. 

+ **Identity** - Israelites circumcised and celebrated Passover to identify themselves as God's people. All Christians today have God's seal to identify them as God's people. Am I being mindful of my identity and the presence of the Holy Spirit to always walk in lock steps with God?
