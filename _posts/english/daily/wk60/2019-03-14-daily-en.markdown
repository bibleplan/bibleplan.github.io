### Question     
Why had the kings of Israel from generation to generation not done what was right in the eyes of the Lord?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. For a long time, the Lord kept Israel under the power of Hazael king of Aram and Ben-Hadad his son. 

+ Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. 

+ Elisha died of illness and was buried. A dead man's body touched Elisha's bones and the man came to life. 

+ Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah became king and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. Amaziah faced Jehoahaz king of Israel in battle. Judah was routed by Israel. 

+ Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel became king in Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The kings of Israel never removed the high places. Are there things in my life which displease the Lord that I fail to remove? 

+ **Integrity** - What was Amaziah's attitude after he had defeated the Edomites? Why did he fail afterward? What does this remind me of?
