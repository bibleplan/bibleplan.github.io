### Question     
How may we win over the world?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement in Christ Jesus. 

+ Anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 
+ We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know Him who is true. And we are in Him who is true by being in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - It is faith that enables us to win over the world. Do I have the faith to win over the world? 

+ **Identity** - Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. Knowing that Jesus Christ has given me eternal life, let me thank Him and praise Him in prayer! 

+ **Fidelity** - If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. What can I pray for those who have sinned?
