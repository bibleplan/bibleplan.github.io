### Question     
What is correct attitude in showing hospitality to our brothers and sisters?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ We as God's children, must testify about our faithfulness to the truth and how we continue to walk in it. 

+ We ought to show hospitality to those who went out in the name of God so that we may work together for the truth. 

+ Do not look up to those who love to be first and not welcome the workers of God with malicious nonsense. Learn to do good in love and truth. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - When we show hospitality to those workers of God who are away from home, we are working together for the truth. John said in the Second John, even just a simple greeting to those spreading malicious nonsense is doing evil with them. Contrast these two, what warning do I see? Whom am I being responsible to by showing hospitality to these workers? What is faithful service?
