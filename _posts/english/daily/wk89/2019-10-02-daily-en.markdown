### Question     
What was the end of Belshazzar?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ King Belshazzar gave a great banquet. While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that they might drink from them. 

+ The fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall. 

+ All the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant. The king brought Daniel to read the writing. 

+ Daniel rebuked the king that he did not humble himself to give glory to God and therefore, God sent the hand that wrote the inscription. 

+ Daniel read the writing that God had already numbered the days of Belshazzar's reign and brought it to an end. 

+ That very night Belshazzar was slain. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Belshazzar was punished for his pride. What difference was there between him and his father? What caused the difference? What does it remind me of?
