### Question     
What are the marks of Paul's claim as an apostle?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Boasting on one's own is foolish. Paul did not want to boast, but he boasted to demonstrate the marks of apostle. Paul suffered (11:23-33); Paul was given visions and revelations from the Lord (12:1-10); Paul persevered to demonstrate through signs, wonders, and miracles, the marks of apostle (12:12); Paul loved the church of Corinth as his own child (11:7-11, 12:14-18); He gave his all to build up others (12:19-21). 

+ Paul reminded all that by God given authority, apostles do not tolerate sins. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Paul's self-depiction presented the life of a faithful servant of the Lord. He boasted in order for others to see clearly the marks of a true apostle. How do I distinguish between a true and a false apostle? What aspects of my life do I boast as being spiritual? What are superficial? Ask God to remove the foolish part of me so that I may boast in Him. 

+ **Community** - Paul's harsh words came out of his love and his will to build others up. When a limb of Christ has sinned, we should point it out for love and to build up. Have I backed off for the fear of confrontation when someone has sinned? Do I point finger at others for being different or do I point out the truth?
