### Question     
What attitude shall we hold when giving in the Lord?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ We shall give willingly according to our God given ability. 
+ We shall give like Jesus for He was rich but became poor so that we may become rich through His poverty. 
+ We shall give as to sow seed to bear the fruit of righteousness. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - To help and give willingly to brothers and sisters in Christ when they are in need is pleasing to God. Through giving willingly we practice being like Jesus who gave graciously. Let me pray for willing hearts in giving for myself and my family. Let me teach my children the meaning of "Freely you have received; freely give" and share our blessings with others.
