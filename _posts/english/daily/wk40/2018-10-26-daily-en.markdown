### Question     
What example of apostle did Paul give us?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Apostles do not wage war as the world does but by the power of God. 
+ Apostles build up others rather than tear them down. 
+ Apostles do not boast of work done by others but boast in the Lord in the sphere of service God has assigned. 
+ Apostles worry about the purity and faithfulness of the believers' belief. 
+ Apostles lower themselves to elevate others and never become burdens. 
+ False apostles' end will be what their actions deserve. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What is the relationship between God and the true apostles as described by Paul? By what do they wage war? How do they follow God's lead? What does it mean by boasting in God? Am I a true apostle? 

+ **Community** - How do true apostles treat limbs of the Christ's body? What shall I do to build others up rather than tearing them down when there are conflicts between myself and others?
