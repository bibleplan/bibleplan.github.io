### Question     
What is the source of sin? What is the source of righteousness?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Sin and death entered the world to all people through Adam for he sinned once.  

+ Life and grace came to all people where all may be declared righteous through Jesus Christ for His one righteous act. 

+ Grace wins over sin, Righteousness reigns in life through grace wins over sin which reigns by death. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God grace is greater than Adam's sin so that we may win over sin in our daily lives through grace. Do I have any sin that I'm unable to overcome? Trust God and ask Him for His grace to overcome my sin.
