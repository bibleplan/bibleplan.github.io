### Question     
Who is the righteous judge?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Humanity is sinful for they know God but neither glorify nor give thanks to Him. Although they know they would be judged for their evil conducts but still do those things and approve of others who practice them. 

+ No one is righteous but only God can be the judge of that. 

+ Religious ceremonies cannot save us. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What is circumcision? Who is the true Jew? Although we don't have the custom of circumcision, do we have other customs that might make us feel superior subconsciously to others? 

+ **Community** - Humanity is sinful and filled with corruptions. But we have no authority to judge anyone. What does He mean when our Lord says whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself? What are the differences between committing sin and judging?
