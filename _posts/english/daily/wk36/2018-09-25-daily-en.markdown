### Question     
How does a sinner become righteous?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Man's unfaithfulness does not diminish God's faithfulness. Our unrighteousness makes more apparent God's righteousness. 

+ There's no one righteous. All are under God's judgment. 

+ Through God's grace and Jesus' salvation, those who are faithful are declared righteous. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Through faith in Jesus Christ, we are given righteousness. What is my value being declared righteous? What should be the focus of my life to be commensurate with this value? 

+ **Fidelity** - Should God not judge us for our sins if God's righteousness is made more apparent by our unrighteousness? Should those who stumble argue with God? How should I serve God whole heartedly without looking for excuses?
