### Question     
How do the outer suffering from outside and the inner misery enrich those who have faith in God?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God is the Father of compassion and God of all comfort. As we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ. With this suffering and comforting we may comfort those who are suffering. 

+ We are not to grieve each other, but with a firm love, bring joy to each other in the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Christian life is not always smooth sailing. What is suffering in Christ when the distress comes? How do I submit to God's purpose and become comfort for others? 

+ **Community** - Is the joy in Lord for the other Christians the goal of my relationship with them? Do I prioritize my own defense when being wronged? When others have done wrong, do I prioritize the enforcement of righteousness on them over their repentance and acceptance of God's salvation? 

+ **Integrity** - What should be the source and basis of my plans? What promises can I give to others? What should be the basis of my promises?
