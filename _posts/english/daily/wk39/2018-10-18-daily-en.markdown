### Question     
How should we assist each other?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul reminded the Corinthian church to collect donations to assist the church in Jerusalem. 

+ Paul reminded the church of Corinth to not hold any bias against Timothy for they might look down upon him.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Can I stand firm on the truth? Do I have a mature spiritual life or is it still in its infancy? 

+ **Integrity** - Do I have the love to assist financially those brothers and sisters in need? 

+ **Fidelity** - The household of Stephanas were devoted to the service of the Lord's people. Am I following their example?
