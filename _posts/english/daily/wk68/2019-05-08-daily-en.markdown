### Meditation: God's Story   
+ During the seventh year of king Artaxerxes' reign, Ezra brought the second wave of Israelites return to Jerusalem. 

+ God was with Ezra, caused Artaxerxes to provide Ezra everything he asked for and the gold and silver articles for worship in the temple, as well as the tax burdens of the Levites and priests. 

+ Ezra called on the Levites to return to Jerusalem to serve in the temple. 

+ Ezra refused the protection from Artaxerxes' soldiers but fasted and petitioned to God for protection. 

+ The hand of God protected them from enemies and bandits along the way. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Ezra fasted to petition to God for protection and refused Artaxerxes' protection. He believed God is His only protector and provider. When I face challenges, do I first go to God? What did Ezra's faith remind me? 

+ **Fidelity** - Ezra called on and prepared the right people to help him to serve God. Am I co-working with others in concert to serve God?
