### Meditation: God's Story   
+ David, together with the commanders of the army, set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun for the ministry of prophesying, accompanied by harps, lyres and cymbals. They casted lots into twenty-four groups. 

+ The gatekeepers, through their leaders, had duties for ministering in the temple of the Lord, casted lots for each gate. 

+ Ahijah was in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries for the dedicated things. 

+ From the Izharites: Kenaniah and his sons were assigned duties away from the temple, as officials and judges over Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - We see the importance of music in worship as David assigned workers responsible for music in the temple to enable them to worship with music. How do I view music in worship? 

+ **Fidelity** - David's workers served according to their gifts. Do I know what my gifts are? How may I thank the Lord for other people's gifts have and serve with them?
