### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Israelites served the king were on monthly duty throughout the year. 

+ The leaders of the tribes of Israel. 

+ The officials in charge of King David's property. David's counselors. Joab was the commander of the royal army. 

+ David told the people about his wish to build a temple. 

+ David gave his son Solomon the plans for the temple. He encouraged Solomon to be strong and courageous and do the work. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - David wished to build the temple but when God told him not to, he obeyed because God's will is higher than his will. Have I experienced similar situation in my journey of faith? 

+ **Community** - David displayed his reliance on God in the encouragement he gave Solomon. How do I encourage my children?
