### Question     
How did Paul testify for the truth under the persecution?

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ Sadducees’ inability to see resurrection proves limitation of human’s wisdom. 

+ Lord’s protection came again as Paul was transferred to Caesarea when the plot to kill him was being planned. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** – For God’s truth reveals all fallacies that Paul was able to point out the heresy of his accusers even under the great political pressure against him. How should I do more to understand God’s way, the only truth? 

+ **Identity** – Even people in high positions such as Felix would be afraid when they hear about righteousness, self-control, and judgement to come. World’s definition of success and status won’t help us in anyway in God’s eternity. The fruit with eternal value comes out only from relationship with God.
