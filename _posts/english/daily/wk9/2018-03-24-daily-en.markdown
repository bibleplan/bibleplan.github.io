### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The third offering involving fire. 

+ Part of the Fellowship Offering was given to God, some to the priests, and the rest can be given to those made the offering (see Leviticus 7.) 

+ Fellowship Offering is a thanksgiving offering and a peace offering (between man and God). It's an offering to bring about relationship. It points to the blood of Jesus reconciles man with God. 


### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Imaging the joyful scenery of Fellowship Offering. How does this help me realize Jesus had reconciled my relationship with God? Fellowship Offering is also a thanksgiving offering. How does this help me recount and thank God for all the blessings I have received? 

+ **Community** - "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God." (Matthew 5:9) Peacemaking is not just for the peace between men but men and God. Whom around me do I need to pray to bring them to God to have peace with Him?
