What are the things around the Tabernacle?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Things around the Tabernacle. The Ark, table, lampstand, altar of incense, alter of burnt offering, basin for washing, courtyard. 

+ God elected different people to complete His works. Each person had different skill and responsibility. Moses was the leader and he passed down the instructions from God and commands all workers. Ithamar, son of Aaron, accounted the materials. Bezel and Oholiab were the craftsmen. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God elected me, gave me a gift and responsibility to serve Him. Do I value my gift and responsibility and know that I am an important part of His work, a valued vessel? 

+ **Fidelity** - God elected different people. Each has his/her own gift and responsibility. Moses was the leader among them passing down God's instructions. Do I seek God's leading, realize my calling, and value my identity as His vessel when I serve?
