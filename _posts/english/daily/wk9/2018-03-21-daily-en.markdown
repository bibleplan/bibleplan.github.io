### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The last task and the completion of Tabernacle. 

+ Everything used in and for Tabernacle were made by the craftsmen with their own designs. They were all made as the Lord commanded. "As the Lord commanded" appeared eight times in this chapter signifies the importance of His command.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - The name of the twelve sons were on the priest's garment. Each time the priest went into the Tabernacle, the twelve tribes went in with him. We are being called the Royal Priests in this age. Do I remember to bring with me the prayers of fellow Christians to God? 

+ **Fidelity** - Obey is better than sacrifice (1 Samuel 15:22). A service pleasing to God requires complete obedience. Do I focus on seeking His will and practice "as He commanded" when serving?
