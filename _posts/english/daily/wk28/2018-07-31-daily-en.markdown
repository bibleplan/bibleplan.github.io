What were the important events on the way to Jerusalem?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus again predicted His own death and resurrection. 

+ Disciples argued amongst themselves who would be the greatest. Jesus talked about the attitude needed of the disciples. 

+ Jesus predicted His own death and resurrection the third time. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus taught disciples: "Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all." This is a total opposite from the world's view of success and status. Am I willing to accept this teaching? Can I do it? What is the biggest challenge? 

+ **Community** - When Jesus talked about marriage, He said: "What God has joined together, let no one separate." How do I understand this teaching? Do I stand behind the vow I took, view my marriage as a vessel in our sanctification, and grow together spiritually with my other half through love?
