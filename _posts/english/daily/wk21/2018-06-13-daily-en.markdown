### Question     
What were Joshua's last words to the Israelites?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Chapter 23 is Joshua's final encouragement to the heads of the Israelite tribes. Chapter 24 is Joshua's final encouragement to the entire Israelite community, to renew the covenant with God. 

+ Joshua counted the blessings God gave Israelites to remind them to fear the Lord and serve Him with all faithfulness. Do not serve other gods and do not inter-mix and marry the gentiles. 

+ Joshua let the people choose, made covenant with them, and set up a large stone as witness. 

+ Joshua and Eleazar passed. The bones of Joseph were buried in Shechem. The age the Israelites wandered in the desert ended. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Joseph had faith in God's promise and his bones testified for God long after his passing. Pray to God to strengthen my faith as Joseph's and make my life a witness to God's glory. 

+ **Fidelity** - What does the final encouragement Joshua gave to the Israelites mean to me? Am I willing to put myself and my family in front of the Lord to serve Him? How should I live out my life in serving the Lord?
