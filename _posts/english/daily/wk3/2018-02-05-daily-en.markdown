### Question     
How did God fulfill His promise to Abraham's descendants?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The story of promise continues. The birth of the son of promise, Isaac. 

+ Abraham was on the move again to the land of the Philistines and he once again called Sarah his sister. God kept Sarah, and thus the birth of Isaac the son of the promise. Isaac grew, and Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away. Abimelek and Abraham in peace with each other. 
### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Abraham, the father of faith, once again lied to the Gentiles that Sarah was his sister and put others in danger. Have I been overpowered by sin repeatedly? What lessons can I learn from Abraham's sin act? 

+ **Fidelity** - Ishmael was not the chosen descendant of God, but God still watched over him. How does this remind me of how to treat people who don't know God?
