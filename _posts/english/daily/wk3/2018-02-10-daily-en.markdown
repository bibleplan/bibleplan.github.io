### Question     
How did God's promise and blessings continue?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jacob got Isaac's blessing through deception and fled. 

+ Isaac wanted to bless Esau but was old and had no clear vision. Rebekah helped Jacob to deceive Isaac and gotten the blessing that was meant for Esau. Esau was mad and wanted to kill Jacob. Jacob followed his parents will and fled to Laban. Isaac blessed Jacob before he left and reaffirmed the covenant God has made with him. Jacob met God and prayed to Him.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jacob pursued God's blessing not His presence. God found Jacob instead and changed his life. Do I prioritize God's blessing over His presence? Pray to God to help me know him and follow him, one step at a time. 

+ **Integrity** - Although Isaac loved Esau more than Jacob, he obeyed God to bless Jacob when he learned His will. Obedience was a standout character of Isaac. Have I ever disobeyed God? How does Isaac's example remind and help me to be obedient?
