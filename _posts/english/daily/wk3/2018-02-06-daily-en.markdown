### Question     
What should be the response to God's promise?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Through God's test of Abraham's faith we learn how we should respond to His promise; Abraham got the first piece of land God promised him. 

+ God tested Abraham and asked him to offer Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham was obedient through faith and God supplied the ram instead. God's Covenant to Abraham was reaffirmed again. Sarah died and Abraham bought land to Bury Sarah. It was the first piece of land he had in the promised land. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ Walk with God - Abraham got to know more about God with the test: The Lord Will Provide. Have I or am I experiencing tests in my own journey of faith? How have these tests helped me to know more about God? 

+ **Integrity** - What have I learned about faith and the actions that come from faith through the story of Abraham's offering of Isaac? (Ref. Hebrews 11:17-19, James 2:21-22)
