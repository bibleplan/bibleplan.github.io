### Question     
What did Jesus say at the end of the Bible?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord is coming soon! His reward is with Him and He will give to each person according to what they have done. 

+ I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. 

+ If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. And if anyone takes words away from 
this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - John wrote at the end of the book: Come, Lord Jesus. Is John's wish also my hope? Why do I (or don't I) have such hope?
