{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the last days the mountain of the Lord's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains. 

+ He will judge between many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. 

+ The Lord will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever. 

+ Many nations are gathered against them. But they don't know the thoughts of the Lord. Rise and thresh, daughter Zion, break to pieces many nations. 

+ Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel. 

+ He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. 

+ The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. It is by His calling that we may have the eternal life.
