### Question     
How did God change Jacob, the son of promise?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jacob's change and meeting with Esau. 

+ Jacob was full of fear as he went toward home. But God wrestled with him and changed him. God changed Jacob's name to Israel and he reconciled with his brother Esau. 

+ God changes people when they lost all hopes. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Jacob tried to reconcile with Esau through his own way. But was full of fear when he heard Esau had come with 400 people. He tried to hold onto God under this desperate situation and God removed Jacob's power, changed and blessed him. Under what kind of situations do I try to hold onto God? How does God bless me? Think back and remember what God has done for me. Have I grown to know Him more? 

+ **Integrity** - Jacob's life had changed completely after this. He became humble and submissive when met with Esau. How did God change my life through my experiences?
