### Question     
How did God continue with His plan through Jacob's sons?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jacob's sons sold their brother Joseph to Egypt foreshadows God's redemption plan. Genesis 38 is an important chapter of Jesus' lineage . Tamar was one of the few women recorded in the history. Her faith humbled and ashamed Judah. 

+ God proceeded with His salvation plan through the jealousy of Jacob's sons as well as Tamar's faith. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Although Tamar followed the tradition to give her husband an offspring, but God was still pleased with her faith. Judah also admitted that Tamar was more righteous. How does Tamar's faith encourage me? 

+ **Integrity** - Driven by Jealousy, Joseph's brother sold him to Egypt. Jealousy came from unsatisfied heart of comparison. How do I practice "Love is not Jealousy" and apply that to my life?
