### Question     
How does the Gospel of Mark start?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ The Gospel of Mark starts with Jesus’ identity and the events while He preached. 

+ John the Baptist proclaimed Jesus’ mission which was already written in the Book of Isaiah. 

+ God’s voice from heaven proclaimed Jesus as His son. Jesus withstood the temptations from Satan. 

+ In Capernaum, Jesus drove out the impure spirit, healed the sick, and cleansed the leper. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – The leper said to Jesus: “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” Jesus cleansed him. Do I have faith in God where if He is willing He shall accomplish? Is there anything I need to pray to God with this kind of faith? Let me pray and thank God for His grace and ask for His mercy. 

+ **Fidelity** – They left their nets and followed Jesus right away when He called Peter and Andrew. Do I often follow Jesus’ calling and will? Is there anything I still have a firm grip on and unable to let Jesus take control?
