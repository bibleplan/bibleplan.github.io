### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus is the Lord of Heaven and Earth. 

+ He calms storm and sea and controls the demons of the spiritual world. 

+ He healed woman who bled for twelve years and brought back to life Jairus's daughter. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Are we scared like the disciples in the storms of life? Pray and ask God to strengthen my faith to face the challenge and ride the tempest of the day. 

+ **Integrity** - When she realized what was done on her, the woman who suffered bleeding came fell in front of Jesus trembled with fear, told Him the truth. Do I fear God and being humble in front of Him? Is there anything I shall give thanks to Him today?
