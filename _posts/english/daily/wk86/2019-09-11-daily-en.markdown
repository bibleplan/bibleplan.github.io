### Question     
What was the end of Tyre that used to be prosperous?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Because Tyre boasted against Israel, the Lord was against it and would bring many nations against it. 

+ From the north the Lord would bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 

+ All the princes of the coast would be clothed with terror and appalled at Tyre. 

+ The Lord had the prophet took up a lament concerning Tyre, prophesying it would turn from great trades and wealth to become broken and no more.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Tyre, like many great cities and nations of past, no longer exists. Do I look at the great and wealthy cities of today more than God's eternal kingdom?
