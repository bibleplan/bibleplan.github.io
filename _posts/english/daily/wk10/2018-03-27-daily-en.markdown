### Question     
What is the offering for offenses against God or another man?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The last of five offerings. 

+ 5:14-19 is for offenses against Holy Objects whether knowingly or unknowingly. 6:1-7 is for offenses against other people, fraud, stealing, robbery, and oppressive actions. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - No matter if it's something we are born with or acquired in life, we need God to forgive and clean. Jesus Christ made the ultimate offering for us so that we can be seen as righteous by God. We are, however, weak and continue to sin. God established High Priest in time of Old Testament to help the Israelites. What has our Highest Priest, Jesus Christ, done for me so that I may be cleaned and purified from my sins? 

+ **Identity** - "They will be forgiven for any of the things they did that made them guilty" when Israelites brought the Sin Offering in the time of Old Testament. Am I struggling in sin and unable to face God? How does this promise help and encourage me?
