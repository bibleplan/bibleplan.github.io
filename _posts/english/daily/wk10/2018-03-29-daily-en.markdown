### Question     
How are God's priests ordained?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The second part of the Book of Leviticus. Records the regulations on ordination of the priests and their service. Chapter 8 and 9 are about Aaron and his sons being ordained as well as the first offering. 

+ Everything followed God's regulation when Aaron was ordained. 

+ God showed His glory and His fire consumed the offering when Aaron the high priest completed the first offering. The people shouted for joy as God was pleased. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The process of ordaining the high priest is long and complex. The high priest needs to be cleaned, consecrated, wait for 7 days and makes a sin offering for himself before he can serve. Nowadays, Jesus Christ is our high priest. What are the differences between Aaron and Jesus Christ? How does this help me understand the salvation of Jesus Christ? 

+ **Identity** - The people shouted with joy when they saw God was pleased with Aaron's offering. This shows that God had accepted Aaron as high priest. God showed His pleasure numerous times when Jesus came to earth in the New Testament. Pray to God to help us shout in joy with Jesus Christ's offering!
