### Question     
Why did Jeremiah pray to the Lord for the people?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought. 

+ Jeremiah prayed to admit guilt, but the Lord wouldn't allow him to pray for the well-being of this people. 

+ Jeremiah accused the false prophet to prophesy lies in God's name with false visions and delusions. 

+ Jeremiah wept for the people's suffering. 

+ The Lord would not go out to this people and told Jeremiah to send them away from His presence. 

+ The prophet lamented about his own trouble where everyone cursed him. But the Lord promised to deliver him for a good purpose. 

+ Jeremiah prayed God to remember and care for him. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Jeremiah prayed for the people to God not to leave them, even when being cursed by them and refused by God. Do I have the heart to love others' souls like the prophet and willing to pray for their salvation?
