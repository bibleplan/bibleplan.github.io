What sins did the remnant of Judah commit?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord blamed the people for burning incense to and worshiping other gods that aroused His anger to destroy them. 

+ The Lord was determined to take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt. 

+ All the men living in Lower and Upper Egypt said to Jeremiah, "We will not listen to the Lord, we will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her." 

+ Jeremiah warned them, "The Lord could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The remnant of Judah went to Egypt experienced the fall of their nation but still wouldn't repent and continued to worship idols. How may I learn obedience from my past sins?
