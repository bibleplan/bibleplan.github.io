### Question     
How did Jesus win over Satan's temptations?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, He came into scene in front of the Israelites. 

+ Jesus got baptized in water then went into the wilderness for forty days to be tempted by Satan. This was analogous to the Israelites where they went through the Red Sea and then wondered for forty years in the desert. However, Lord Jesus Christ won over Satan of all temptations whereas the Israelites failed time after time. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The temptations Jesus went through were the same as the Israelites: bodily necessities (food and water), testing God's will (Israelites went into Canaan without God), profit from following Satan (golden calf, Baals). Israelites failed on all tests but Jesus won all with God's word. Jesus had set great examples for us to follow and be strengthen by Him so that we may win over temptations. What temptations have I won over through God? What temptations have I conceded to because I did not rely on God?
