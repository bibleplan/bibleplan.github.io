### Question     
What power did Jesus display through the miracles He has performed?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The chapters 8 and 9 record the miracles Jesus performed which displayed His great power had won over Satan's. 

+ Two independent contents were inserted in between the miracles: 1. The cost of following Jesus (8:18-22); 2. Opposition to Jesus and the beginning of His persecution (9:9-17). 

+ Jesus had compassion on the crowds when He saw them as lost sheep without a shepherd which brought out the Great Commission in later chapters. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The power of Jesus is greater than Satan's. What challenges am I facing now? What power did Jesus show through the miracles He performed would allow me to see that none of my challenges is greater than God's authority? Jesus is merciful and has compassion to us who are lost. He is the good shepherd. How should I become familiar to His voice and follow Him to turn away from Satan's lies and troubles of the world? 

+ **Fidelity** - There's a price to pay to follow God. Am I willing to pay that price and commit myself to Him today?
