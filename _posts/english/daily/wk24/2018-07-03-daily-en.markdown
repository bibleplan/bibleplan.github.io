### We now pause on the Old Testament and continue with the Gospel of Matthew preaching to the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah they have been waiting for.

### Question     
What promise of God was realized with the birth of Jesus?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Genealogy of Jesus is recorded in Matthew. He was a descendant of Abraham and David. He was of royal identity (1:1-18). 

+ Jesus was born of virgin Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit, as God promised (1:22-23). 

+ The Maji from the east followed God to come to see Jesus (2:1-12). 

+ From Joseph leading family to escape Herod to Egypt and later coming back to live in Nazareth, all have been foretold by God's prophets (2:15-23). 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Every step of Jesus' birth fulfilled what God had said through His prophets. God's promises do not change because of man's weakness. Do I keep a tight grip on things because of my worries? Seeing God's faithfulness reminds us His promises. Let me come to God and pray to Him and ask Him to carry my burdens and take away my worries.
