### Question     
What did Jesus and the disciples encounter in places where they preached?

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ Jesus said: “The Son of Man did not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them.” (9:56 NKJV) 

+ Jesus sent seventy disciples to preach. They came back joyously and Jesus gave thanks to God. 

+ Jesus used the example of the Good Samaritan to explain the command to love your neighbor. He compared Martha and Mary to explain the command to love God. 

+ Jesus taught the disciples how to pray. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** – To the disciples for they wanted to destroy the Samaritans with fire, Jesus rebuked them that they did not know their own spirits. How do I face those who don’t accept me? Do I continue to love them as God does or turn away and curse them? 

+ **Fidelity** – Jesus sent out the seventy in pairs to go ahead of Him. Do I have coworkers serving with me? Are we following Jesus and serving in unity?
