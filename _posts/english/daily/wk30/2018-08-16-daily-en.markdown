### Question     
What kind of person can be brother of Jesus?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ Jesus uses the parable of sower to depict the different people’s reactions to the truth. 

+ Jesus said: “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.” 

+ Jesus calmed the storm and drove out the demons into the pigs. 

+ The woman who bled for years was healed for her faith. Jairus’ daughter was raised from dead for his faith. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – The woman who bled for years would not dare to ask Jesus directly but touched His cloak from behind wished to be healed. Can I come fearlessly to Jesus and ask for His grace because I have faith in Him? 

+ **Integrity** – “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.” Am I listening carefully to the voice of Holy Spirit?
