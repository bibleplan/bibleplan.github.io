### Question     
How did Jesus train His disciples?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ Jesus sent the twelve out to preach. 

+ Jesus fed five thousand with five loaves of bread and two fishes. 

+ Peter declared Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus predicted His death and resurrection and encouraged the disciples to take up their crosses and follow Him. 

+ Jesus went up a mountain and transfigured. A voice in the cloud proclaimed Jesus as God’s son. 

+ The disciples argued among themselves whom would be the greatest. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – Jesus fed five thousand to their satisfaction with five loaves of breads and two fishes. How do I view God’s promise and supply to our daily needs? Am I still worrying about tomorrow? 

+ **Fidelity** – Jesus said: “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me.” Am I willing to serve all who are in need? Whom around me is in need?
