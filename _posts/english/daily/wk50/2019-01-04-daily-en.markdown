+ There will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord. Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 

+ God's response to those lawless, men or angels, has always been the same since ancient time. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping. 

+ The false teachers blaspheme in matters they do not understand; Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They left the straight way, never stop sinning, are experts in greed, seduce the unstable; They mouth empty, boastful words, and they entice people by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh.

The heresies and depraved conducts from the false prophets and false teachers of this age caused blasphemy of Jesus' truth. How does that disturb me? Has today's passage bring certainty and hope to me? Why?
