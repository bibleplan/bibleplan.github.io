### Question     
How did Solomon place the Israelites and foreigners after the completion of the temple and palace?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram had given him, and settled Israelites in them. 

+ Solomon conscripted the descendants of all those people remaining in the land who were not Israelites to serve as slave labor. 

+ Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers. 

+ On the altar of the Lord that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord. 

+ In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties. 

+ All Solomon's work was carried out, so the temple of the Lord was finished. 

+ Hiram sent Solomon ships commanded by his own men, sailors who knew the sea. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Solomon built the temple and rebuilt the villages so that the Israelites may settle there. What effect did his action bring? How should I pray for the leaders of my country?
