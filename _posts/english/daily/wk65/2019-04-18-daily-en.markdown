{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. 

+ The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents. 

+ King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth. All the kings of the earth sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart. 

+ Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. Then he rested with his ancestors and Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The riches of Solomon came from God by His promise. God also promises fulfilled lives to all His children. Do I have that life? 

+ **Fidelity** - The queen of Sheba went to see Solomon for his wisdom. How may I bring people to Christ by His pleasing aroma?
