### Question     
How does God's salvation plan continue among the nations?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The tenth segment of the family history of Adam and Eve. The account of Shem's family. 

+ This history connects Abram (Abraham), the ancestor of Israel, to Noah's son Shem and the history of the world. In another word, it connects the history of man's downfall to God's salvation plan. Luke 3:34-36 reminds us the importance of this family for their offspring Abraham will bring blessings to all people. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God saves the people of His election. Do I understand I am one of the elected ones? 

+ **Fidelity** - Can God use me to bring salvation to those people I know, such as family, friends, or co-workers?
