### Genesis tells the story that God created man out of His own image, man's downfall due to sin, and God's plan and choosing of an imperfect nation to start His salvation process.

### Question     
Where did the world come from?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Chapter 1 verse 1 to chapter 2 verse 3 is the beginning of the book of Genesis. It is the prelude to the rest of the Bible. 

+ God created the world from His word.  All was good and He created man and woman from His image; He rested on the 7th day and made that day Holy.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ Walk with God - How does understanding that all things in the world are created by God's word helps me to know the power of His word? Do I doubt the power of His word in transforming my own life? 

+ **Identity** - How does it help to know my own value and worth knowing that God created me with His own image?
