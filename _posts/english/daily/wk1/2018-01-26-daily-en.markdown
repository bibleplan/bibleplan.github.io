### Question     
How did the human history develop after the great flood?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The fourth segment of Adam and Eve's family history, the account of Noah's sons and their families. 

+ The offspring of Noah's sons Shem, Ham and Japheth became many of the ethnic groups familiar to Israelites. They then build the tower of Babel which caused them to scatter and speak different languages. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - People build tower of Babel to glorify themselves. Am I to glorify God or myself with the works I have? 

+ **Fidelity** - My service at church came from God's calling or to satisfy my own desire? Do I often ask God and follow His will in serving?
