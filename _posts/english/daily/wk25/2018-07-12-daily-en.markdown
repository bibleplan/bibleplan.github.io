### Question     
What made those on the boat see Jesus as the Son of God?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The suspicion on Jesus' identity and the discussion on His wisdom and abilities were more intense. Jesus fed five thousand, walked on water, and those on the boat worshiped Him as the Son of God. 

+ The pharisees challenged Jesus with the elders' traditions. Jesus pointed out to them that they broke God's command for the sake of the tradition. 

+ Jesus continued to heel more, fed four thousand more, and the people were amazed and praised the God of Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - As Jesus began to reveal His true identity, some were more doubtful and refused Him while others got to know Him deeper. How did God lead me to know Him deeper? Did I ever refuse Him? How did God bring me out from the dead end?
