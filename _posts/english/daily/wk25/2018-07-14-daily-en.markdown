### Question     
To be the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven whom should one become?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The disciples asked Jesus who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus answered that the greatest would be like a humble little child. Great responsibilities are bestowed on the people of God that we shall not cause others to stumble, not look down on others, but humbly point out others' mistakes, gather in unity and in Lord's name, and forgive each other whole heartedly without reservation. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Jesus set the requirements for people of God to be like Him, as God the highest, but willing to lower and humble Himself to serve, to give, to forgive, to be compassionate, and to build. Have I forgiven those who offended me? Ask God to help me to forgive, help me to repent and remove my sins that might have affected those around me, to help me unite with fellow Christians, and help me to be merciful and compassionate to the lost sheep of the world.
