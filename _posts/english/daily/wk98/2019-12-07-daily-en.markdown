### Question     
What kind of life do children of God live?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ What great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! 

+ And this is His command: to believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as He commanded us. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Now we are children of God, and we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. How am I living out my life as a child of God and be more like Jesus each day? 

+ **Community** - We shall love each other, both in actions and in truth, because this is a command God gave us. How may I love my brothers and sisters more? 

+ **Integrity** - We shall sin no more, for whoever lives in the Lord does not sin. How may I resist temptations and strive to be righteous?
