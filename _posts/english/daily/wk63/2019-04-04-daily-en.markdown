### Question     
What were the David's military accomplishments against the gentiles?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ David defeated the Philistines, the Moabites, and the Arameans. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went. 

+ He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. 

+ David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people. 

+ Hanun humiliated David's envoys.  

+ Joab and Abishai defeated the Arameans and the Ammonites. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - David's undefeated military records in chapter 18 show the realization of God's promise to him in chapter 17. How is God leading me in my life? How am I responding to Him? 

+ **Community** - David sent envoys to comfort Hanun. Instead, Hanun humiliated the envoys and started a war. Have I experienced a similar situation where my good will was ill-treated? How should I view this from the view point of salvation and grace?
