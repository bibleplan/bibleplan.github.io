{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Malachi rebukes Israel for forgetting God's blessing. 

+ The Lord rebukes the priests for showing contempt for His name. 

+ They say the Lord's table is defiled and its food is contemptible. 

+ If they do not listen, the Lord will send a curse on them, and will curse their blessings. 

+ Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying women who worship a foreign god. 

+ The Lord testifies that the Israel have been unfaithful to their wives. 

+ They have wearied the Lord with their words. 

+ The Lord will soon send His messenger, who will prepare the way before Him. But who can endure the day of His coming? 

+ The Lord will come to put them on trial. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - God seeks Godly offspring. So be on our guard, and do not be unfaithful to the wife of our youth. Let me pray for my spouse, family, children, so the state of our relationship pleases the Lord and glorifies His holiness.
