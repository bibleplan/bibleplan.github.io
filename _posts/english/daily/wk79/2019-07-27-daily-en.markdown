### Question     
What was the prophet's foretelling of Judah's exile?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The prophet rebuked the Judah for not listening to the Lord for twenty-three years. 

+ Foretold the Judah would be taken in exile to Babylon for seventy years. 

+ When the seventy years are fulfilled, the land of the Babylonians would be made desolate forever. 

+ God's judgment likened to a cup filled with the wine of His wrath. 

+ Shepherds shall weep and wail for the people. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - The prophet asked the shepherds to weep and wail because the people would be scattered and slaughtered. Do I weep and wail when I see those around me whose souls are yet to be saved? Do I have a heart to love all like God loves the world?
