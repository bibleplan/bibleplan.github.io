### Question     
What is freedom in Christ?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ For those with knowledge shall be careful not be stumbling blocks of those with weak conscience. 
+ The sacrificial food to idols is nothing to God. We don't' gain nor lose anything by eating or not. 
+ If eating sacrificial food to idols causes others to stumble, then don't eat it. 
+ Paul put up his rights so he can preach and not hinder the gospel of Christ. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Paul has all the legal rights but would rather put up with them for the gospel. Does my life in Christ obey the higher authority to live out a life with sacrificial love? 
+ **Community** - Do I often mind about my conduct so I don't stumble those who are weak in faith?
