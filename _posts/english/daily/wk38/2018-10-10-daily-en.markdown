### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul warned the church about sexual immorality for the wrongdoers would not inherit the kingdom of God. 
+ Our past sins have been cleansed in the name of Jesus Christ. By His power God raised the Lord from the dead, and He will raise us also. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Do I realize that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit? Can I remind myself often that I need to live out a holy life? 
+ **Community** - What to do when there's a dispute between Christians? 
+ **Integrity** - How should I be associated with the unbelieved? What should I watch out for?
