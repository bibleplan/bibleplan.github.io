### Question
**How did God ensure the land of those who has no son will not go to other tribes?**

{%- include BibleLinks-en.html -%}

### Meditation: God’s Story
+ With God’s permission, the daughters of son-less Zelophehad inherited his land. The family heads now faced a new problem. Namely, a tribe’s land may go to other tribes in the Year of Jubilee if daughters with inheritances marry men from other tribes. Therefore, by God’s command, Moses ordered: “They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father’s tribal clan.” The daughters obeyed.

### Meditation: My Story
+ **Community** - Zelophehad’s daughters obeyed all God’s commands. These daughters not only cared for themselves but also their father’s property. God’s children should look after not just themselves. Do I follow any of the world’s viewpoints but against God’s? What can I do to care for the church and fellow Christians?
