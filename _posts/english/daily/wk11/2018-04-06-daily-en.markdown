### Question
**Why did the previous generation of Israelites fail to enter the promised land 40 years ago?**

{%- include BibleLinks-en.html -%}

### Meditation: God’s Story
* The priests are set apart from the people for God. The requirements for the priests are even higher. God set clear priority to their duty and daily lives.

* Holy objects are set apart for God. Israelites needed to keep these objects holy.

* The phrases “I am the Lord who makes them holy” or similar appeared 6 times and “I am the Lord” appeared 6 times, as well.

### Meditation: My Story
* Identity – God set high standards for the priests. How does today’s passage reminds me that I am a chosen royal priest?

* Fidelity – What’s my priority compare tasks at hand and serving God? What do the requirements God set for the priests remind me?
