### Question
**What festivals do the holy people need to observe?**

{% include BibleLinks-en.html %}

### Meditation: God’s Story
* Chapter 23 lists all the festivals the Israelites need to observe. Including Sabbath, Passover, Festival of Unleavened Bread, Offering the Firstfruits, Festival of Weeks, Festival of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, and Festival of Tabernacles.

* 24:1-9 lists the regulations for the lamps and breads in the Tabernacle.

### Meditation: My Story
* Walking with God – What are the commonalities of the 7 festivals in chapter 23? What do they remind me? There are still many Christian holidays nowadays, but many have lost their original intent. What should I do in these holidays for the remembrance of my savior?
