### Question
**What are the other regulations to keep Israelites holy?**

{% include BibleLinks-en.html %}

### Meditation: God’s Story
* More regulations to keep Israelites holy so they can worship God.

* Chapter 15 is about bodily discharges. It was aimed to keep the Israelites “separate from things that make them unclean.” This is so that “they will not die in their uncleanness for defiling my dwelling place.”

* Chapter 16 is the regulation for the Day of Atonement. During this day, all Israelites need to keep sabbath, deny themselves, cleanse, and atone for all their sins.

### Meditation: My Story
* Identity – All offerings and cleansing were to help the Israelites to become a nation of holiness. It was to separate them from the unclean. The holy God promised to walk with me and asks me to be holy. What does this remind me?

* Integrity – God established the annual Day of Atonement. Israelites could restart from a new beginning with their sins forgiven. But this did not mean that they could take their sins lightly. My sins were forgiven because of Jesus Christ. How do I view my own sins?
