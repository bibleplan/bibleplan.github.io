### Question     
What was Zechariah's mission? 
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord told Israel to turn to Him through the prophet Zechariah. 

+ Zechariah has a vision of a man mounted on a red horse who has gone throughout the earth. 

+ The angel asked the Lord, how long will you withhold mercy? The Lord spoke kind and comforting words to the angel. 

+ Zechariah saw four horns that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. 

+ Zechariah saw a man with a measuring line in his hand to measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is. 

+ Flee from the land of the north, for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven, declares the Lord. 

+ Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The Lord told Israel to not be like their ancestors, but to turn from their evil ways and evil practices. Am I hearing God's voice in Bible? Am I willing to turn from my evil ways and evil practices?
