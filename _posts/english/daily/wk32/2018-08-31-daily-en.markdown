### Question     
What did Jesus do after His resurrection?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to two who were on the way to Emmaus. 

+ Jesus appeared in Emmaus and Jerusalem. 

+ Jesus commissioned the disciples and then was risen into heaven. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus opened the disciples' minds so they could understand the scripture from Moses to everything written about Himself. Am I able to see God's plan and Jesus from the Old Testament? Pray and praise God for His omnipotence and thank Him for His eternal plan. 

+ **Community** - The disciples did not believe the women who told them the fact that they saw an empty grave without Jesus. How do I treat my fellow Christian's testimonies? Can I accept them by the faith in our Lord?
