### Question     

What were the last events before Jesus' arrest?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus and disciples had Passover supper together. 

+ Disciples disputed who would be the greatest. Jesus predicted Peter to disown Him three times. 

+ Jesus was arrested at Gethsemane then put on trial before the council. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Jesus asked his disciples to pray so they wouldn't fall into temptation. Do I pray often for my own spiritual life? As my spiritual life is being molded, how do I avoid falling into temptation? 

+ **Fidelity** - Peter was confident that he would not disown Jesus. Do I know the biggest weakness in my heart? How does the understanding of that weakness help me stay away from temptation?
