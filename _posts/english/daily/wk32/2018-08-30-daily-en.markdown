### Question     
How was Jesus crucified? 

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus was brought in front of Pilate for trial. 

+ The crowds were willing to let go of Barabbas but wanted to crucify Jesus. 

+ Jesus was buried in a grave which no one had yet been laid. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The curtain in the temple was torn in two when Jesus died. The separation between God and man was reconciled since. Do I understand my close relationship with God and come to Him without fear? 

+ **Fidelity** - Joseph went to Pilate asking for Jesus' body to burry in the grave dug out for himself. Am I being compassionate and serve fearlessly?
