### Question     
How was Jesus betrayed and taken?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In His last hours on earth, Jesus told His disciples: "As you know, the Passover is two days away-and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified." (26:2) 

+ The Holy Communion was established and took place on the Passover Supper. 

+ Jesus prayed in Gethsemane, was betrayed by Judas, got arrested, and was denied three times by Peter.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - How does Jesus' sorrow in Gethsemane help me during my time of sorrow? Do I understand He knows the difficulties and challenges I face and He can carry my burdens for me? 

+ **Identity** - Do I understand the meaning of the cup and bread in the Holy Communion that Jesus has established for His disciples?
