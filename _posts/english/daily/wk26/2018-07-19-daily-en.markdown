### Question     
What and how Jesus' disciples need to be prepared for the end of times?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The need to serve and to be alert as the end of times is near. The parable of the Ten Virgins teaches us the importance of being alert and be prepared because no one knows when Jesus will come again. 

+ The parable of the Bags of Gold tells us to serve faithfully while waiting for the second coming of the Christ. 

+ When Jesus comes again, those who are in His kingdom will take the inheritance while the others will be judged. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Am I waiting alertly for Jesus' second coming? If He comes today, can I have the assurance in getting the inheritance?
