Meditation: God's Story 
---
+ Israelites started their complaints again just three days out of Sinai. This angered God and
burned some of them until Moses prayed for them.

+ God was angered again when Israelites craved for other food. Moses pleaded to God. God
brought up people to help Moses and sent plague to the Israelites to cut off the greedy.

+ Aaron and Mariam talked against Moses due to their jealousy. The Lord came down to fault
them. Miriam contracted leprosy had to leave camp for 7 days. Aaron atoned and pleased for
Miriam immediately.

+ God values His faithful servant. God strengthens when he is tired, avenges when he is wronged.

Meditation: My Story 
---
+ Walking with God – Like they were at the foot of Mount Sinai, the Israelites complained just
three days out of Sinai. There are always peaks and valleys in our spiritual lives. How does the
lesson Israelites received help me?

+ Community – Aaron atoned and pleaded for Miriam. Moses did so for Aaron and Miriam, too.
Am I willing to forgive others? Am I willing to pray for them?

+ Integrity – Bible said the rabble craved other foods. Am I a rabble in my spiritual life? Do the
medias influence my thoughts? Can I turn to God’s word to block out the bad influences?
 
+ Integrity – It is not a display of weak faith when Moses was tired and prayed to God. God helped
him and avenged for him. Am I being wronged by others? Do not worry, pray and let God be the
judge.
