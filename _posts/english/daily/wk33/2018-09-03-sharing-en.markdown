### Forward     
We continue the reading of the Book of Acts this week.

Some said the Book of Acts is actually a book of Holy Spirit's Acts in which the actions of the Holy Spirit can be seen all throughout. With the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, we gain the ability to testify His work. Without Holy Spirit, nothing accomplishes. If we are busy serving without a moment for devotion in our lives, we'd jeopardize our services. For if we rely our services on our flesh, how are we to testify the work of Holy Spirit?

We are easily distracted and often substitute the work of Holy Spirit with other efforts. Extravagant showmanship may bring entertainment to satisfy the eyes and the ears with sight and sound. It may leave deep impressions and provide profound attractions. But how is that different from a ball game or a concert? Can it be sustained in life's most difficult times? Nothing is brought forth without Holy Spirit. Our testimonies are from God, in His presence, with prayers and patience, until the Holy Spirit grants us visions and moves our hearts.

May God's word renew you all every day!

### Question     
+ How did the Holy Spirit raise the first church?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Holy Spirit filled the apostles to enable them to speak in tongues of different native languages of the crowds declaring God's wonders. 

+ Peter addressed the crowds that Jesus is the Messiah. 

+ About three thousand heard and accepted his message were baptized and added to their number that day. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Would I feel being cut to the heart and come to God to ask for forgiveness if someone spoke of my past sins, whether intentionally or not? We all need someone who can point out our spiritual weaknesses. More importantly, we need to listen to Holy Spirit's guidance. 

+ **Fidelity** - Peter said: "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation." We would not turn a blind eye to the unbelievers if we understand from bottom of our hearts the corruptness. Do I truly understand the corrupt generation I'm in?
