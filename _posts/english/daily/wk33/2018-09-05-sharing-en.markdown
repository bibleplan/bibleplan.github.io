### Question     
Where would the early church go when it faced deception, imprisonment, and complaints?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The outcome of deceiving the Holy Spirit puts our hearts in awe and fear. 

+ The Lord enabled the apostles to perform many signs and wonders. More men and women believed and added to their numbers. Those who were sick or tormented by impure spirits were healed. 

+ Prosecution could not stop the apostles. To the opposite, they were encouraged to preach more. 

+ A Pharisee named Gamaliel wisely asked others not to fight against God. 

+ As disciples increased in number, the needs of church grew. So, seven were chosen to "wait on table." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Peter and the other apostles said: "We must obey God rather than human beings!" Have I obeyed human beings due to peer pressure for my conduct in work or life? 

+ **Fidelity** - Gamaliel wisely pointed out what comes from God cannot be stopped. Have I been oblivious of God's hand behind the scene due to my ignorance, perspective, or personal interest? Let me humble myself and seek God's will often.
