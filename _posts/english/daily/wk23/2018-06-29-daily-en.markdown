### Question    
What life testimony did the Gentile Ruth live out?

{%- include BibleLinks.html -%}

### Meditation: God's Story  
+ Ruth gleaned in the field for mother-in-law Naomi and herself and was protected by the gracious Boaz.

+ Ruth was richly rewarded just as Boaz's blessing for her: "May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."

### Meditation: My Story  
+ **Identity** - Ruth, a Gentile woman, her love for Naomi and faith for God became a great testimony to the Israelites. God's grace covered the Moabite woman Ruth a plenty even though the law dictates that the Moabites are not chosen as His. It's God's election that changes our identity. What's my identity before and after I have come to know God? How do I identify myself and my value now?

+ **Integrity** - What Boaz saw in Ruth was not lust but her faith in God. From what can I see Boaz's tenderness and respect toward Ruth? How should I view those who are in need?
