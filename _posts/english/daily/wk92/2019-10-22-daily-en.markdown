### Question     
What were Israel's sins? 
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 
### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise again, deserted in her own land, with no one to lift her up. 
+ This is what the Lord says to Israel: Seek me and live. 
+ I hate, I despise your religious festivals; your assemblies are a stench to me. Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. 
+ Woe to you who are complacent in Zion, and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria, you notable men of the foremost nation, to whom the people of Israel come! 
+ You will be among the first to go into exile; your feasting and lounging will end. 
+ You rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar and say: Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength? 
+ The Lord God Almighty declares, I will stir up a nation against you. 
### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Israelites rejoiced in the conquest of Lo Debar and said: Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength? God hates the proud but is graceful to the humble. Am I leaning on my own strength over God's?
