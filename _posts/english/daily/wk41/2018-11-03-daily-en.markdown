### Question     
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ By His work on the cross, Jesus Christ unified the Jews and the Gentiles into one to create a new people. This work of Jesus' alone brought the Gentiles who had no part in God into His kingdom to receive His inheritance. 

+ By His work on the cross, Jesus destroyed the wall between the Jews and the Gentiles so that we are not defined and separated by our races, accomplishments, or background. Instead, we are unified as one in the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus through His works on the cross gave us a new identity: People of God. What do I see as important identities in my daily life, occupation, politics, country, race, heritage, or family? We can only cause isolation if too much emphasis is placed on any of these identities. Only when we place the utmost importance our identity as People of God, we would then be able to connect with God and unite with others through Him. 

+ **Community** - Jesus through His works on the cross put to death the hostility between us and God. He brought together the ever-contentious Jews and Gentiles to unite them into one people. What hostility do I have still toward others?
