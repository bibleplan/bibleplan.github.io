### Question     
How do we gain freedom through God's promise?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ We became God's children through His promises, not through our works of being slaves of the law. 

+ Jesus Christ released us to grant us freedom. If we burden ourselves again by the yoke of slavery of the law, then Jesus' redemption becomes meaningless. 

+ In Christ, the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love, not by bondage of the law. 

+ In Christ, we wait eagerly through the Spirit by faith the righteousness for which we hope. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What are the differences of being free children of God and being slaves under the law? Although I have not been through the law as the Israelites, are there other laws burdening me in my life that cause me to forget my status as a child of God and live like a slave? 

+ **Walking with God** - A life freed from slavery expresses itself through love. What does a faith like this bring about in my life? Reflect in my life, when have I seen the outcome of such faith?
