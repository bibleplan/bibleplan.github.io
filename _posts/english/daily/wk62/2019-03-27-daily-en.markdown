### Question     
Who were the descendants of the tribes to the west of Jordan river?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The sons of Issachar. 
+ The descendants of Benjamin. 
+ Sons of Naphtali.  
+ The descendants of Manasseh. 
+ The descendants of Ephraim. 
+ Asher's sons.   
+ The detailed genealogy of Benjamite. 
### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The accounts of the tribes recorded in chapter 7 were relatively simple. Is my life's journey with or without God? Is it filled with the story of God or is there not much to talk about?
