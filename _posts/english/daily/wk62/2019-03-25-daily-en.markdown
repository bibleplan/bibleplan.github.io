### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Six sons were born to David in Hebron and thirteen sons in Jerusalem. These were sons of David besides the ones by his concubines. Tamar was their sister. 
+ Sons of Solomon.  
+ The descendants of Judah. 
+ The descendants of Simeon. 
### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Here recorded Jabez's prayer to God, "Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain." And God granted his request. What meaning does this special account have for me? How may I pray to God in a similar way?
