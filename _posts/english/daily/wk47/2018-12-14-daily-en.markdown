{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord is the source of growth of our spiritual lives, we shall depend only on Him and make Him the goal of our focus. 

+ Jesus is the great high priest of grace and faith, the priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. 

+ Jesus is able to empathize with our weakness, has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet He did not sin. 

+ Jesus completely obeyed God's will to bear for us our suffering. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - How am I willing to accept and understand those who are weak in faith or have already fallen to encourage them to get closer to God? 

+ **Integrity** - Bible teaches us to move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity. Are you mature or still in the infant stage of your spiritual growth? How would you move forward in the knowledge of truth?
