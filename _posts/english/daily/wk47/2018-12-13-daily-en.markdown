### Question     
In what does Jesus surpass Moses?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Moses was a servant of God in the old testament, but he fell far short of Jesus who is the Son of God. 

+ Jesus builds the house of eternity. 

+ We ought to make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following the example of disobedience. 

+ The word of God is alive and active. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Have I entered God's rest? What is impeding me from entering God's rest? 

+ **Community** - Am I often encouraging and lifting up others so that they would not be deceived?
