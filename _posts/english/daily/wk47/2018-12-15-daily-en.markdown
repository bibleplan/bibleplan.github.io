### Question     
What are the differences between the priesthood of Jesus and Aaron?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus is the great high priest in the order of Melchizedek, not of the Aaron's. 

+ Jesus is eternal and His priesthood is forever and permanent so that He is able to save completely those who come to God through him. 

+ Melchizedek blessed Abraham. Jesus surpasses any man and blesses all mankind. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - What role does Jesus, the great high priest, play in my relationship with God? Jesus is worthy of all praises and glories. How am I worshiping Him every day?
