### Question     
How was Jeremiah sent by God?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. 

+ Before the Lord formed Jeremiah in the womb He knew him, before he was born He set him apart; He appointed him as a prophet to the nations. 

+ Jeremiah saw the branch of an almond tree and a pot that is boiling, tilting from the north. 

+ From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land. 

+ The Lord commanded Jeremiah: "Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - When the Lord sent Jeremiah, He told him not to be terrified, for He had made him a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall. Although people went against Jeremiah, they could not overcome him because God was with him. Appreciate how God protects His servants and be encouraged and be filled with confidence in serving Him.
