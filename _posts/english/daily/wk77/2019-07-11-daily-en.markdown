### Question     
How did Israel stray from the Lord?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Israel was holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his harvest. 

+ But their ancestors strayed far from the Lord. They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. 

+ Has a nation ever changed its gods? But people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols. 

+ Your wickedness will punish you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord your God and have no awe of Him. 

+ On every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute, turned your back to me, yet when you are in trouble, you say, "Come and save us!" 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Israelites exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols, be appalled at this, you heavens. Am I worshiping worthless idols to satisfy my fleshly desires?
