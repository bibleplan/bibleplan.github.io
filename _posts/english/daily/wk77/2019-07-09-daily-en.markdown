### Question     
How do the new heavens and new earth look?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the new heavens and a new earth, the former things will not be remembered. Be glad and rejoice forever in what the Lord will create. 

+ Heaven is the Lord's throne and earth is His footstool. The ones He look on with favor: those who are humble and contrite in spirit. 

+ Those who exclude you because of my name will be put to shame. 

+ Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her. 

+ The Lord is coming with fire, He will bring down His anger with fury. 

+ The Lord is about to gather the people of all nations and languages, and they will come and see His glory. 

+ The name and the descendant of chosen will be made to endure. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The Lord creates new heavens and new earth but will look on with favor those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at His word. Am I justified in God's eye? Am I humble and ready to repent with fear of His holiness?
