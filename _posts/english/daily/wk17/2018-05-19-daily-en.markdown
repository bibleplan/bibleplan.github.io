### Meditation: God’s Story  
+ Not everyone may enter the assembly of the Lord. Holiness and cleanliness must be kept as God is around. Properly treat the runaway slaves. Ban on shrine prostitutes. Ban on loan interest. Vow payment must not be delayed. Grapes and kernel of grains may be eaten but not taken away.

### Meditation: My Story  
+ **Integrity** – The Israelites’ camp must be kept clean and holy because God moves about in the camp. God is among us every day. Am I constantly examining myself to ensure there’s no uncleanliness or unholiness in my heart or behavior to separate me from God?
