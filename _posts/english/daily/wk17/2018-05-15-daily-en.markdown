### Meditation: God’s Story  
+ `14:3-29` repeats what can be eaten and what can’t. Consumption of the tenth produced as well as the first born of herds and flocks in presence of God at the place where God has chosen. At end of every three years, the tithes were to satisfy the Levites, foreigners, fatherless and widows.

+ `Chapter 15` reiterates the once every seventh year, the Sabbath year, the year of cancelling debts. Freeing the slaves and setting apart the firstborn male of the herds and flocks. 

+ `16:1-17` talks about the regulations on Passover, Pentecost, and Festival of Tabernacle. 

### Meditation: My Story  
+ **Walking with God** - God gave me everything I have. Am I willing to offer a tenth to Him?

+ **Walking with God** - We need to watch over and take care of the helpless to live out the life from merciful God. Have I paid attention to those around me who may need my help?
