### Question    
Who were the cities of refuge established for? What is proper way of going to battle in the eyes of our Lord?

### Meditation: Godâ€™s Story  
+ God established the cities of refuge for those who killed unintentionally. However, those who willfully kill would be put to death.

+ Any crime or offense needs two or three witnesses to convict the accused. No malicious witness is allowed.

+ Do not be afraid when going to battle. However, those who have just build a house, just planted vineyard, just got married may stay behind. Anyone who is afraid may stay behind. Offer peace to enemy first, engage in battle only if they refuse.

### Meditation: My Story  
+ **Walking with God** - God established the cities of refuge because He knows that people would avenge on those who harmed them even if it was unintentional. Have I forgiven those who might have hurt me?

+ **Integrity** - God is fully considerate of those who have just build, planted, and married to allow them to stay behind. Am I being considerate of others and put myself in their shoes?
