### Question     
What was the effect of gospel in the morally deficient cities such as Corinth and Ephesus?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ A year and half after establishing the church in Corinth, the Lord said: "I have many people in this city." 

+ Going through Ephesus marked the completion of the second missionary trip. The third missionary trip started right after. 

+ Three years into establishing the church in Ephesus, many have repented and the word of Lord spread widely and grew in power. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Those who practiced sorcery in Ephesus burnt their expensive scrolls in public and turned away from their sinful past. Is there anything lingering in me that shackles me in sins? Pray and ask the Lord to grant me strength to escape from my sins.
