### Question     
How was Barnabas and Paul's first missionary trip like?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Holy Spirit called Barnabas and Paul to go out on mission. 

+ The proconsul Sergius Paulus saw Paul won over the false prophet with God's power and believed in God. 

+ Paul spoke in Synagogue and many believed Jesus as the savior of all people. 

+ The Jews rejected much of what they had heard, and the apostles turned to preach to the Gentiles. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Antioch sent off their most important co-workers to go on mission with Paul. Can I set my mind to the Kingdom and to help build others, to raise co-workers, and make my church a missional church?
