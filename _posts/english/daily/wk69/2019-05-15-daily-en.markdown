### Question     
Why did all the people come together?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the seventh month, Ezra read aloud the Law before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law. 

+ Nehemiah and Ezra said to the people: "This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength." 

+ The whole company built temporary shelters and lived in them. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What were the people's reaction when Ezra praised the Lord, the great God? When I worship, do I shout out amen from within my heart? 

+ **Identity** - Why did the people weep when they listened to the word of the Lord? Why did they celebrate in great joy later? Have I experienced similar feeling when worshiping God?
