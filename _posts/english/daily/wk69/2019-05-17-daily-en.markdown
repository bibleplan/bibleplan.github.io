+ List of those who sealed the agreement. 

+ The rest of the people who separated themselves for the sake of the Law of God, all bond themselves with a curse and an oath, to follow 
the Law of God given through Moses and to obey carefully all the commands, regulations and decrees of the Lord. 

+ They assumed the responsibility for carrying out the commands to give a third of a shekel each year for the service of the house of God.
