### Question     
What did Jeremiah say about the other nations?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jeremiah prophesied the Ammonites' punishment. Rabbah would become a mound of ruins. 

+ The Lord would restore the fortunes of the Ammonites afterward. 

+ The Lord would bring disaster on Esau at the time when He punishes him. Edom will become an object of horror. 

+ Damascus had become feeble, she had turned to flee and panic had gripped her; anguish and pain had seized her. 

+ Kedar and Hazor would be attacked, taken and carried off. 

+ Elam would be scattered to the four winds, then restored. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - How did pride of the Ammonites, Kedar, Hazor, and Elam stand by the Lord? Where is my pride?
