### Question     
How did Jerusalem describe her own pain?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jeremiah laments the capturing of the people of Zion. How deserted lies the city, once so full of people! Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are on her cheeks. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies. 

+ Jerusalem describes the insufferable pain was inflicted on her, that the Lord brought on her in the day of His fierce anger. 

+ Jerusalem admitted that the Lord is righteous, yet she rebelled against His command. 

+ Jerusalem pleaded to the Lord to see that there's no one to comfort her in her distress. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Zion laments that her pain was the result of righteous judgment from the Lord. Does the suffering in the world today come from God's judgment? What's the source of suffering? How should I face suffering?
