Bible Reading

[{{ verse1 }}][bgLink1] | [[YouVersion]][yvLink1]

Meditation: God’s Story
---
+ Leviticus 24:10-22 records the punishment laid upon a Gentile who blasphemed against God and
thus committed an offense of the 3 rd law of the ten commandments. “You are to have the same
law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the Lord your God.”

+ 25:1-22 are about the regulations on Sabbath Year and Year of Jubilee. 25:23-55 talks about the
necessary attitude toward property and poverty to realize the meaning of Sabbath Year and
Year of Jubilee.

Meditation: My Story
---
+ Walking with God – Sabbath occurs after 6 days of work. Sabbath Year occurs after 6 years of
work. The Year of Jubilee occurs once after every 49 years. What was God’s intention for these?
Do I know the true meaning of Sabbath? Do I often take refuge in God?

+ Community – 24:17-22 records the punishments for injuring others and their animals. In 25:23-
55 records the attitude toward property and poverty. What is my attitude toward other people
around me and their property?
