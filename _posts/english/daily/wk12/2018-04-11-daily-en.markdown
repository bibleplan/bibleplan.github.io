### Question
**How does man redeem from his vow to God?**

{%- include BibleLinks-en.html -%}

### Meditation: God’s Story
+ Redeeming what is Lord’s is a very serious business. Man often take a vow to make wishes to
the Lord during distress but then forget his vow afterward. Bible often warned against this type
of behavior. This passage set a relatively high redeeming price with additional 20% for those
who forget their vows.

### Meditation: My Story
+ Walking with God – God dislikes those who don’t follow through with their vows. We must be
prudent when signing a contract or making a promise. Have I made any promise to God, to my
spouse, my friends, or my children? Do I always keep my promises? What should I do if I’m ever
in breach of my promises?
