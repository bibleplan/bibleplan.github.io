Bible Reading

[{{ verse1 }}][bgLink1] | [[YouVersion]][yvLink1]

Meditation: God’s Story
---
+ Redeeming what is Lord’s is a very serious business. Man often take a vow to make wishes to
the Lord during distress but then forget his vow afterward. Bible often warned against this type
of behavior. This passage set a relatively high redeeming price with additional 20% for those
who forget their vows.

Meditation: My Story
---
+ Walking with God – God dislikes those who don’t follow through with their vows. We must be
prudent when signing a contract or making a promise. Have I made any promise to God, to my
spouse, my friends, or my children? Do I always keep my promises? What should I do if I’m ever
in breach of my promises?
