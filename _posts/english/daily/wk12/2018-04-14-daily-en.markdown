### Question
**How did God make Israelites the holy nation?**

{%- include BibleLinks-en.html -%}

### Meditation: God’s Story
+ God called the Israelites to become His holy nation.

+ The laws to keep the Israelites clean:
  * Restitution for wrongs: to keep Israelites united.
  * Holy marriage: to keep the descendants clean.
  * Nazirites: a special testimony to God’s calling.
  * Aaron’s blessing: Reaffirmed God’s promises and pointed the Israelites to the promised land.

### Meditation: My Story
+ Community – God made the Israelites His and established laws and rules on restitution to keep them united. Do I value the unity of Christians or am I damaging it?

+ Fidelity – God put great emphasis on fidelity in marriage. Do I value my marriage as holy and being faithful to my spouse?
