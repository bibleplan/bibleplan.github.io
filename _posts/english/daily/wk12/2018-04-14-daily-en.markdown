Question
---
How did God make Israelites the holy nation?

Bible Reading
---
[{{ verse1 }}][bgLink1] | [[YouVersion]][yvLink1]

Meditation: God’s Story
---
+ God called the Israelites to become His holy nation.

+  The laws to keep the Israelites clean:
  1 Restitution for wrongs: to keep Israelites united.
  2 Holy marriage: to keep the descendants clean.
  3 Nazirites: a special testimony to God’s calling.
  4 Aaron’s blessing: Reaffirmed God’s promises and pointed the Israelites to the promised
land.

Meditation: My Story
---
+ Community – God made the Israelites His and established laws and rules on restitution to keep
them united. Do I value the unity of Christians or am I damaging it?

+ Fidelity – God put great emphasis on fidelity in marriage. Do I value my marriage as holy and
being faithful to my spouse?
