### Question
**What are the blessings for being obedient and the punishments for disobedient?**

{% include BibleLinks-en.html %}

### Meditation: God’s Story
+ Proclaim the blessings and punishments after the covenant was made.

+ Verses 3 to 13 are the blessings: rain comes, crop grows, peace in the land, and Israelites’ number increase.

+ Verses 14-46 are the punishments: disasters, crop dies, losing war, famine, and people die. Not all disaster would come all at once. God always give His people chances to repent and turn around. Each time a disaster strikes, the next disaster comes only “`if in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me.`”

### Meditation: My Story
+ Identity – God blesses His people. He blesses those who obey His commands and love Him. Do I often see God’s mercy and love by counting the blessings He has bestowed on me?

+ Integrity – God sends disaster to people not to punish them but to give them a chance to turn around. What characters of God do I realize from the incremental disasters He places? Have I in my life been reminded or impeded by Holy Spirit? Am I willing to understand His will and turn around to obey Him?
