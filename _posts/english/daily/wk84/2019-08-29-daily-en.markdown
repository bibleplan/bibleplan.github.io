### Question     
Who were slaughtered and who were spared when the glory of God came?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord commanded to bring those who are appointed to execute judgement on the city, each with a weapon in his hand. 

+ The glory of God went up to the threshold of the temple. He called to put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament but slaughter all the rest. 

+ The Lord commanded a man to fill his hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city. 

+ The glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple. Beside the cherubim were four wheels sparkled like topaz. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Who received the marks and were spared? What does this message say to me? How does it alert or comfort me?
