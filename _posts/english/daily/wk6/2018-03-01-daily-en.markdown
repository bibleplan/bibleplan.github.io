### Question     
What did God do when Pharaoh's heart continued to harden?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Pharaoh never completely obeyed God and continually to bargain in "partial submission" even after so many plagues. God is all knowing and omnipotent. His will is always accomplished. There's no bargaining with God. 

+ God commanded Moses to tell his descendants everything happened in Egypt. God works wonders and we should let everyone know. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Moses transformed from a cowardly and undecisive person to a faithful servant of God who was able to stand up against the Pharaoh on all things. What kind of transformations can I see from a person who walks with God? What can I learn from Moses? 

+ **Integrity** - Gone through plagues after plagues, Pharaoh continued to rebel against God because of his pride. Do I know clearly God's greatness? Am I willing to submit to Him completely?
