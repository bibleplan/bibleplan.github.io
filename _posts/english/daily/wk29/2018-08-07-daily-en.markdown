### Question     
What happened after Jesus' death?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Two women saw a young man dressed in white in the tomb told them that Jesus has risen. 

+ Jesus appeared in front of many and rebuked the disciples for their lack of faith. 

+ Jesus commissioned the disciples to preach gospel to all creations and He worked with them as they went. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Mary and two disciples saw Jesus after His resurrection and told the other disciples. But they did not believe them. What should be our attitude toward others' testimonies? Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to point the way of the truth and help us to accept each other. 

+ **Fidelity** - Jesus commissioned the disciples to preach gospel to all and promised to work with them as well as confirming His word with signs. Do I know that Jesus is working with us all today? How does this truth change my attitude toward service?
