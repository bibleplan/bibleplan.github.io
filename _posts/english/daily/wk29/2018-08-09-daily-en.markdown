### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus' birth in a manger in Bethlehem. Angel brought the good news to shepherds. 

+ Simeon and Anna the prophet testified for Jesus' identity and gave glory to God. 

+ Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Who would have thought that God's son was born in a lowly manger? For God does not value material abundance but spiritual blessing. What do I value more? Is my pursue of material takes priority over God? 

+ **Fidelity** - Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man. In the upbringing of my children, do I value such growth? What do I need to pray for my children?
