### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul prayed and was grateful for all who had joined him in spreading the gospel. 

+ Paul being chained in prison was made beknown to all as a witness for Christ and helped spread the gospel. 

+ Paul's value: to live is Christ and to die is gain. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Pray to God to help me root deeply in my heart that it is my connection with Christ and realization of my new life that I would find my life is Him and to die is also a gain. 

+ **Community** - Paul was thankful every time he remembered those who joined him in spreading gospel and was always happy to pray for them. Pray to God to remind me to pray and be grateful for my fellow Christians often. 

+ **Fidelity** - Paul had no reservation for everything thing happened to him had helped spread the gospel. Pray to God to help me know and understand that gospel is not just for my own benefit alone but for the benefit of God's kingdom.
