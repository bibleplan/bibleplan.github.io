### Question     
What was the genealogy of Israelites' ancestors?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Genealogy from Adam.  
+ The family of Abraham.  
+ Esau's sons.  
+ The people of Seir.  
+ The rulers of Edom.  
+ Israel's sons.  
+ Sons of Judah.  
+ Hezron's sons.   
+ Sons of Caleb.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The first in the genealogy of Israel was Adam. What does it mean to the Israelites? What does it mean to us? 

+ **Integrity** - Er and Achar (Achan) were pointed out specifically for of their sins. What kind of legacy do I want to leave for myself, good or evil?
