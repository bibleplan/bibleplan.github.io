### Question     
How did God save Hezekiah?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Hezekiah sent the palace administrator and the secretary to the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah foretold the Lord's deliverance. 

+ The angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. 

+ The Lord healed Hezekiah's illness and added fifteen years to his life. 

+ Hezekiah let Babylonian king's envoys to see all the treasures in his storehouses.  

+ Isaiah prophesized that the entire Judah would be taken to Babylon. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What was the main point of Hezekiah's prayer? What can I learn from this prayer? 

+ **Integrity** - Why would Hezekiah's showing the treasures to Babylonian envoys bring about Isaiah's prophesy? How should I treat my blessings from God?
