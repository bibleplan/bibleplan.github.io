### Question     
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. But then he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and rebelled. 

+ Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim succeeded him as king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. 

+ The officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem and laid siege to it. Jehoiachin surrendered to king of Babylon. 

+ The king of Babylon took the treasures from the temple of the Lord and carried all Jerusalem into exile. 

+ Zedekiah reigned in Jerusalem eleven years then rebelled against the king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and built siege works all around it. 

+ Jerusalem was destroyed and the temple was plundered. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Why didn't God come to rescue Judah when the situation deteriorated, and the temple and people were plundered by the king of Babylon? How do I understand God's kindness and righteousness?
