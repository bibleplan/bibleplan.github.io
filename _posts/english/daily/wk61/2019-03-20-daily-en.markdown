### Question     
How Judah started to decline after Hezekiah?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Manasseh reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. 

+ Through His servants and prophets, the Lord proclaimed He would bring disaster on Jerusalem and Judah for the detestable sins Manasseh had committed. 

+ Amon reigned in Jerusalem two years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. 

+ Amon was killed and Josiah his son succeeded him as king. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - After Hezekiah, Manasseh rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. How do I view the influences of family and sin? 

+ **Fidelity** - With Judah's decline yet again, we can see how easily people stray away from God and how a king can bring down a nation. How am I influencing others? Is it for good or bad?
