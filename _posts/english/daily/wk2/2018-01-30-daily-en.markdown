### Question     
How did God protected the land He has promised Abram?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Continue from previous day's scripture describing how God protected the land He promised Abram. 

+ Abram and Lot separated due to the arguments between their shepherds. Lot chose the land that looked fine but full of sin. Abram rescued Lot and people of Sodom and became the blessing of these people. 

+ Genesis 2:4-4:26 is the first of the ten segments of Adam and Eve's family history. 

+ God created man and put him in the Garden of Eden. God also made Eve out of Adam's rib so help each other and become one (Gen 2:4-25); The serpent deceived man and caused him to be separated from God (Gen 3:1-24); Man's downfall continued with Cain's murder of his brother Abel to Lamech's arrogance. Only then, people began to call on the name of the Lord (Gen 4:1-26)  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - What does the downfall of Adam and Eve tell me? Am I doing things not to God's liking due to my own pride and desire? 

+ **Identity** - Am I willing to call on God's name and face my own heart?
