### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The becoming of the land, people, nation that were not pleasing to God. 

+ As God going to judge Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham pleaded to God for them. Lot protected the angels and the angels led him out of Sodom. Lot's daughter got offspring with human's way. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Although Lot has learned God's mind; his wife ignored the warning and looked back; his daughters got offspring with their way. How does Lot's story remind me? How should I build a Godly family? 

+ **Fidelity** - Abraham pleased to God for the sinful Sodom. What can I do for our sinful world today?
