### Question     
How did God promise Abram's offspring?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The story of continuing promise. God's covenant with Abram's offspring. 

+ God promised Abram that he would have offspring too numerous to count, will go back to the promised land. Abram and Sarai still attempted with their own effort and followed their own way. Even in human's weakness, God is still faithful in His promise. His love went beyond Abram and took care the suffering Hagar. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Although Hagar was a slave, she was still in God's care. What encouragement and comfort does her story give me today? 

+ **Integrity** - Despite the promise of God, Abram and Sarai often showed lack of patience and attempted to do things through limited human power. Have I or am I waiting impatiently? What does the story of Abram and Sarai remind me?
