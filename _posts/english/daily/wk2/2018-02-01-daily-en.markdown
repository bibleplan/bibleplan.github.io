### Question     
How did God strengthen His promise to Abram?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Genesis 17 continuing the theme of God's Promise, the Covenant of Circumcision, reaffirming the promise of the nation, the offspring, and the land. 

+ Before the promise of offspring was fulfilled, God made Covenant with Abram with circumcision, from which Abram and offspring were chosen and to be the blessings of all people. God renamed Abram to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God's promise seems to be out of reach. Abraham lowered his body to God but not in his heart and laughed. Am I a superficial follower by doing things my way? How does God's reaffirmation of His promise encourage me? 

+ **Identity** - God's renaming of Abram and Sarai signifies their new identity. Do I value the new identity Jesus Christ has given me?
