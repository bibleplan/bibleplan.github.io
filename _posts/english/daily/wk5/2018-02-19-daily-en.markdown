### Question     
Can Joseph avoid prison? 

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Joseph got released from prison and put in charge of the whole land of Egypt for interpreting Pharaoh's dreams. God blessed through Joseph everyone around him. At the same time, Joseph tested his brothers who came to Egypt to buy grain. 

+ Joseph saw God's plan through his own experiences and gave glory to God in front of Pharaoh. God brought Joseph's brothers to repentance through his test. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Joseph gave all the glory to God for his ability to interpret Pharaoh's dreams. He did not aim to benefit himself from the God given ability. How does Joseph's example remind me about my own work and service? 

+ **Community** - It wasn't that Joseph did not forgive his brothers when he tested them. It was quite imaginable that Joseph was full of vengeance when his brothers bowed down to him. Can I learn from Joseph and look up to God instead of taking matters into my own hands when someone wrongs me? 

+ **Fidelity** - Joseph was faithful to his job, responsibilities, and worked for the unfamiliar Pharaoh. Take a close look at my own job. What does Joseph tell me my attitude should be?
