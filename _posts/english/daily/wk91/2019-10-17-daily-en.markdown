What did Joel warn the Israelites about?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ A nation has invaded my land, a mighty army without number; behind them, a desert waste-nothing escapes them. 
+ The people of Judah Mourn. The fields are ruined, the ground is dried up; the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the olive oil fails. 
+ Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn. Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly, and cry out to the Lord. 
+ The day of the Lord is coming, the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 
+ Return to the Lord with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and He relents from sending calamity. 
+ Then the Lord was jealous for His land and took pity on His people. 
+ The Lord will pour out His Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. 
+ Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, so when the Israelites return to Him with all their heart, he would be merciful to them. How am I experiencing His mercy?
