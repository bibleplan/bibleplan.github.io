### Question     
What would it be like on the day of the Lord?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord abandoned the descendants of Jacob because they are full of superstitions from the East; they embrace pagan customs. 

+ The Lord Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted. The idols will totally disappear. He is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support. 

+ The Lord rises to judge the people. The Lord enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people and woe to the haughty women. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - List out the people's sins in the passage and compare to today's society. What are we sinning against the Lord today?
