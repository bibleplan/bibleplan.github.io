{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord rebukes those obstinate children who went down to Egypt to seek for Pharaoh's protection. 

+ The Lord rebukes the people for not willing to listen to the Lord's instruction. 

+ Those who look up to the Lord and wait for Him will be blessed. 

+ The voice of the Lord will shatter Assyria; with His rod He will strike them down. 

+ The Israelites shall return to the Lord. 

+ Assyria will fall by sword; they will flee before the sword and their young men will be put to forced labor. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord says: "In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength." Am I willing to rest in quietness and stay in the Lord's peace?
