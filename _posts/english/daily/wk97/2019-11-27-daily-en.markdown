### Question     
Why did Jesus wash His disciples' feet?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus got up from the meal, wrapped a towel around his waist, poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. 

+ Jesus said, "Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me." 

+ A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 

+ By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another. 

+ Jesus said to Peter: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!" 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - For Jesus is our Lord and yet, He washed His disciples' feet. To learn from Jesus' example, we shall wash each other's feet. What does it mean to "wash" feet for each other? Am I willing to wash my fellow Christians' feet?
