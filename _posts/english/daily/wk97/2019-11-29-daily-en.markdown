### Question     
What does the Holy Spirit do when He comes?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ When the Holy Spirit comes, He will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment. 

+ When He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth. 

+ I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. 

+ Jesus prayed to the Father, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you." 

+ Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus said, "This is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent." How do I know God, know Jesus Christ, and receive eternal life?
