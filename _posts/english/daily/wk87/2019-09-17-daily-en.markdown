### Question     
What wrong did the shepherds of Israel do?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord commanded the prophet to prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; to those shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! 

+ The Lord said, I am against the shepherds and I will remove them from tending the flock. 

+ The Lord said, I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. 

+ The Lord said, I will place over them one shepherd and he will tend them. I the Lord will be their God. 

+ The Lord said, I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of savage beasts so that they may live in the wilderness and sleep in the forests in safety. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Are the strong and weak in faith helping each other in Church? How may I help those churches that are weak?
