### Question     
Who defeated Absalom?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ahithophel’s advise was not taken by Absalom which allowed David to avoid demise. This was God’s plan to disrupt Ahithophel and bring destruction to Absalom.

+ David was supplied by Shobi, Makir, and Barzillai at Mahanaim.

+ David deployed his troops and commanded them to be gentle with Absalom. Absalom was routed, his hair caught in the tree and unable to escape. Joab defied David’s command and killed Absalom. David mourned for Absalom.

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** Absalom was defeated despite the great strength from support of all Israel and a very good counselor. It is God who brings victory and it is also God who brings defeat. Is there ungodly power in the circumstance I’m in which seems to be strong and invincible? Looking from this passage, is God who is in absolute control giving me peace?

+ *Integrity** What was Joab’s motive in killing Absalom? What should have he done to be pleasing to God? What news did David want to learn most anxiously from the two messengers? How would David react differently had he submitted to God’s will? Contrast with David’s prayer when Bathsheba’s first son died.
