{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The trapped lion as a parable of Judah king being carried off to Babylon. 

+ The uprooted vine as a parable of Jerusalem's destruction. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - The king of Judah must carry the responsibility for the great destruction and judgement his household and the entire nation faced. How may I pray for the political leaders of my country to lead according to God's will to seek blessings for the people and country?
