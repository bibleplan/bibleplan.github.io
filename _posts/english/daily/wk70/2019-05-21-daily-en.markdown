### Question     
How was Esther selected as queen?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the third year of King Xerxes reign in the citadel of Susa, he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. 

+ When the attendants delivered the king's command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger. 

+ Vashti was removed from her position as queen. 

+ Xerxes searched for beautiful young virgins and Esther was taken to the king's palace. 

+ Esther was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence and the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, so he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - If Vashti did not disobey the king's command, would the Israelite be saved in later day? God's mind is higher than our own. Am I willing to see God's work in everything I encounter?
