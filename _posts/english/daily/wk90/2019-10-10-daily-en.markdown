### Question     
What happened to the Ephraim?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 
### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of reckoning. For God will be like a lion to tear Ephraim to pieces and go away. 
+ Then God will return to His lair until they have borne their guilt and seek His face. 
+ Urge Israelites to return to the Lord so that they may live in His presence. 
+ The Lord said Ephraim's love is like the morning mist. 
+ The sins of Ephraim are exposed and the crimes of Samaria revealed. 
+ Ephraim mixes with the nations and Israel's arrogance testifies against him. 
### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord awakes me and lifts me up. We must endeavor to know the Lord. How may I know Him deeper?
