### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Israelites were in the hands of Philistines for forty years for they again did evil acts. 

+ God commanded the once infertile parents of Samson to dedicate him to God for life as Nazirite. 

+ The Spirit of the Lord came to Samson and gave him great strength that he teared the lion into pieces. Samson acted absurdly ignoring the law and his status as Nazirite. 

+ Samson ignored the law and married a Philistine woman. 

+ Samson planned to take advantage of his companions with a riddle but leaked the answer to his wife. He had to give away his wife and give them cloths from thirty Philistines he then killed. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Samson could have done great things for God with the great power God had given him. But he chose to follow his own will. Although he powered over the Philistines and displayed much personal glory, he paled in comparison to Gideon. Let me learn from Samson's example to put God's will first, obey His commands, and live to glorify God.
