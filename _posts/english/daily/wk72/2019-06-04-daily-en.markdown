### Question     
How would the Lord reach out to reclaim His people?

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse, the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him. 

+ The Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the people, the nations will rally to him. 

+ The Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the surviving remnant of his people. 

+ The Israelites will give praise to the Lord for He is their salvation. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – The savior raised from the Lord will delight in the fear of the Lord. How do I understand what is the meaning of delight in the fear of the Lord? Do I delight in the fear of the Lord? 

+ The remnant of Israel will give praise to the Lord on the day of salvation. All of us are saved by the Lord. How am I giving praises to Him each day?
