### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ A prophecy against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw. 

+ The day of the Lord is near, all the land of Babylon will be destroyed. 

+ The Medes will come up against the Babylon, they will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah. 

+ The Lord once again will choose Israel and will settle them in their own land, foreigners will join them and unite with the descendants of Jacob. 

+ The Israelites will take up a taunt against the king of Babylon. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** – A bright star falls because of his pride to put himself above all the stars of God so he may be equal to God. Is my pride in control of my thoughts and deed?
