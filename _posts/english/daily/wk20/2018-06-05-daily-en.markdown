### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After defeating the kings in the south, the Israelites turned north and conquered the northern kings. 

+ `Chapter 12` summarize the kings defeated by Joshua: two kings to the east of Jordan River and thirty-one kings to the west of Jordan River. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Forty years ago Israelites feared the Anakites. Forty years later, Joshua and the Israelites relied on God to defeat these giants. Are there giants in my life that seem insurmountable? How may I lean on the Lord to defeat them? 

+ **Fidelity** - We see God throughout the Book of Joshua. Likewise, today, God is battling in our stead. He can win and has won. Am I keeping a tight grip of the struggles in my job and services as my own or letting God to take control?
