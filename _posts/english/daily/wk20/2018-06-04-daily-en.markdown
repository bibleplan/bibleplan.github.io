### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Joshua and the leaders of Israelites did not consult with the Lord and was deceived by the Gibeonites (Hivites, 9:7, 11:19) to make peace treaty with them in violation of God's command (Deu. 7:2).  

+ The five kings of the Amorites joined forces to attack Gibeon but was defeated by Joshua and his army. Israelites conquered the southern cities. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The Gibeonites deceived the Israelites and made peace treaty with them because Joshua did not consult with God. Satan tries to deceive us, too. So, we must always ask God to know His will. Do I have anything I need to ask God today so that I don't get deceived by Satan? 

+ **Integrity** - Joshua made the Gibeonites to live among the Israelites after being deceived by them. We too must learn to deal with our mistakes, not overlook them nor overcome by them. Let me examine myself humbly for what I have done wrong and ask God to remind myself of my weaknesses.
