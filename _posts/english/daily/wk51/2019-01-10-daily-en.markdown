### Question     
Why if we love one another then God lives in us?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 

+ This is love: God sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 

+ God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. 

+ We love because He first loved us. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - We are of God and have won over every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus, because the one who is in us is greater than the one who is in the world. What difficulties am I facing? Let the one who is in me be my only reliance and true help so that by Him I'd be able to celebrate in victory. 

+ **Community** - We love one another, for love comes from God. We love because He first loved us. Let me understand and experience God's love, then try to love someone who is unlovable with God's love. 

+ **Integrity** - Love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. What faith and hope does this give me?
