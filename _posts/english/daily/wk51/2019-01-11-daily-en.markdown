### Question     
How do we overcome the world?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement in the Lord Jesus Christ. 

+ Anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 

+ The Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The One gives us victory over the world is our faith. Do I have the faith to overcome the world today? 

+ **Identity** - We have eternal life when we have the Son of God; we have no eternal life without the Son of God. Let me thank and praise Jesus with my prayer in the knowledge that He has already given me eternal life! 

+ **Fidelity** - If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. How am I praying for those who are sinning?
