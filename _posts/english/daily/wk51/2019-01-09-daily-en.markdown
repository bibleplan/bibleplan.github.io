### Question     
What kind of life should the children of God live?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! 

+ And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - We are children of God and we know that when the Lord appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. How am I living a life as children of God and be more like Jesus every day? 

+ **Integrity** - We shall not continue to sin. No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. How am I doing what is right and not being led astray?  

+ **Community** - We should love one another with actions and in truth because this is what God has commanded. How am I loving my Christian brothers and sisters even more?
