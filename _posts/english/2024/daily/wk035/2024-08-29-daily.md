### Question     
What did David do after his victory?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins. David took the crown from the head of their king. 

+ David's army defeated the Philistines three times. 

+ Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. David repented so the Lord sent a plague on Israel. 

+ David bought land from Araunah, built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. The Lord put His sword back into its sheath. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - David and his men defeated the Philistines three times along with the giants they faced. What kind of giants I need to face in my life? How may I gain strength from the Lord to defeat the giants of my life? 

+ **Integrity** - What kind situation was David in when he was incited by Satan to take a census? Why wasn't God pleased with it? When am I vulnerable to the temptations? 

+ **Integrity** - David was pleasing to God but still did things not pleasing to God in his old age. What warnings do I see from this?
