### Question     
What was God's response to David's wish to build the temple?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ David wished to build the temple for the Lord but He said: "You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in." 

+ The Lord promised David that his descendant would build the temple for the Lord and the Lord would establish his descendant's throne forever. 

+ David prayed humbly to the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Why did God refuse David's wish to build the temple? (17:5-6) What did God promise him? God's promise was much greater than what David asked for. Have I been refused by God? What happened afterward? 

+ **Identity** - Read carefully David's prayer. What was David's attitude and knowledge of God and himself reflected in the beginning of the prayer? What can I learn from it?
