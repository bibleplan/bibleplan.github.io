### Question     
How did the apostles, being filled with Holy Spirit, preach?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Peter preached again and about five thousand men believed. 

+ Facing the high priest, Peter fearlessly spoke of Jesus as the only way to Salvation. 

+ All believers prayed together were filled with Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. 

+ God's grace worked in all believers that they shared everything they had and there were no needy persons among them. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus is the corner stone and sets standard for all believers to follow. Do I often reflect my own conduct upon the examples set by Jesus? 

+ **Fidelity** -It is a unique characteristic of early church that all things were shared. Would I assist financially those who are struggling in their livelihood even if it means lowering my own comfort level?
