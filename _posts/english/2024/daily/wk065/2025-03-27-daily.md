### Question     
How did the revelation of Greece come to Daniel?  

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel. 

+ Daniel was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, he had no strength left, face turned deathly pale and was helpless. 

+ The one who looked like a man gave Daniel strength. 

+ Prophesy three more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others and he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece. 

+ The kings of south and kings of north would sometimes go to war against each other and sometimes have peace. 

+ The king of north would set his heart against the holy covenant and desecrate the temple. 

+ Everyone whose name is found written in the book will be delivered. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - What was the view in Daniel's vision on those who are in power? What am I leaning on in this world?
