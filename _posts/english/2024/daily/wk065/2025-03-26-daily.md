### Question     
What were the differences in Daniel's two visions?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the first year of king Belshazzar, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. 

+ Four great beasts, each different from the others. 

+ Daniel was disturbed by the visions and asked one of those standing there the meaning of all this. 

+ In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, Daniel had another vision. 

+ A ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, no animal could stand against it. A goat came from the west. 

+ Gabriel told Daniel the meaning of the vision. 

+ In the first year of Darius's reign, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years. 

+ Daniel turned to the Lord God and pleaded with Him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes, to turn away His anger and wrath from Jerusalem. 

+ Seventy 'sevens' are decreed, to put an end to sin, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The animals in Daniel's vision did as they pleased. What happened to these animals?
