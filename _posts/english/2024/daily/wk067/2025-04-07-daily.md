### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The prophet advises Israel to return to their God. Ask Him to forgive all their sins and receive them graciously. 
+ God will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for His anger has turned away from them. 
+ Who is wise? Let them realize these things. Who is discerning? Let them understand. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - In their prayer returning to God, the Israelites asked God to Forgive all their sins and receive them graciously, that they may offer the fruit of their lips. Do I often offer my repentance through my prayer?
