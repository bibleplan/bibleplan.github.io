### Question     
Why God punishes Israelites of their sins?
{%- include BibleLinks2024.html -%}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God had chosen only Israel of all the families of the earth; therefore He will punish them for all their sins. 
+ The Sovereign Lord has spoken-who can but prophesy? 
+ The Lord warns the descendants of Jacob. On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. 
+ You cows of Bashan, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy. The time will sure come when you will be taken away with hooks. 
+ Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more. 
+ God punished Israel with heavy penalties, and they still don't turn back to Him. 

### Meditation: My Story
