### Question     
Who were the descendants of David and Solomon?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Six sons were born to David in Hebron and thirteen sons in Jerusalem. These were sons of David besides the ones by his concubines. Tamar was their sister. 

+ Sons of Solomon.  

+ The descendants of Judah. 

+ The descendants of Simeon. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Here recorded Jabez's prayer to God, "Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain." And God granted his request. What meaning does this special account have for me? How may I pray to God in a similar way?
