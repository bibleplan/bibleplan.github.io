### Question     
What was the genealogy of Israelites' ancestors?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Genealogy from Adam.  

+ The family of Abraham. 

+ Esau's sons.   

+ The people of Seir. 

+ The rulers of Edom. 

+ Israel's sons.   

+ Sons of Judah.  

+ Hezron's sons.   

+ Sons of Caleb.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The first in the genealogy of Israel was Adam. What does it mean to the Israelites? What does it mean to us? 

+ **Integrity** - Er and Achar (Achan) were pointed out specifically for of their sins. What kind of legacy do I want to leave for myself, good or evil?
