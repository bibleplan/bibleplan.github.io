### Question     
What did Josiah do after finding the Book of the Law?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Josiah reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. 

+ Josiah repaired the temple of the Lord. 

+ Hilkiah the high priest found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord. 

+ After reading the Book of the Law, the king removed all idols and all detestable acts. 

+ Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt killed Josiah. Jehoahaz son of Josiah was made king to succeed his father. 

+ Pharaoh Necho put Jehoahaz in chains then made Eliakim king and changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What was Josiah's attitude in reading the Book of the Law found in the temple of the Lord? What is my attitude when reading God's Word? Has His Word touched me and caused me to repent? 

+ **Integrity** - The good kings mentioned in Bible, David, Hezekiah, and Josiah, all took care of the temple of the Lord. Today, our body is His temple. How am I looking after my own body?
