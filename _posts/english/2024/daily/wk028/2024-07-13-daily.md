### Question     
How does God see the warriors who followed David?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The roster of the warriors who followed David and some of their accomplishments. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - David was not a "Lone Ranger" but faced the enemy and went to war with many. Do I have any brother or sister in Christ to go fight the war of our lives with? Is there anyone who can pray for me, to encourage and to lift me up? 

+ **Fidelity** - What are the commonalities of the warriors on the roster? What can I learn from them?
