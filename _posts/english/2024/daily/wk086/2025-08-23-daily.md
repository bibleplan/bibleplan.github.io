### Question     
By whose sovereignty does God elect?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God's election is by His promise which never fails. 

+ God's election is by His calling rather than our works. 

+ God's election comes from His mercy rather than our will and endeavor. 

+ It is by God's sovereignty a vessel may be elected and given glory. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - If it is God's will to elect then why are we punished for our sins? Same question was asked in Paul's time and continued to be asked now. What was Paul's answer? Let me try to explain it with my own words so I can provide a clear explanation when asked. 

+ **Integrity** - Paul's love for the Jews is seen in the verse 9:3 even though he was being persecuted by them! This is not a fleshly love, not a worldly love, but a Godly love. Are there people in my life who are unlovable? They might have misunderstood or hurt me. But let me pray and ask the Lord for a merciful heart to help me love through Him.
