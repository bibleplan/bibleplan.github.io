### Question     
How to unite with Jesus Christ to escape from sin through Him?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Through baptism, we die with Jesus Christ; Through His resurrection, we live by uniting with Him and live to be like Him. 

+ Dead to sin. Alive in Christ. Offer ourselves as obedient slaves to righteousness. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - What does dead mean in dead to sin? What does alive mean in alive in Christ? How does these remind me what should my attitude toward sin be while facing the stubborn sins of mine? How do I unite with Christ to escape from the authority of sin? 

+ **Walking with God** - Is there any area of my life where I submit to my fleshly desires and let sin reign? What does it mean to offer myself as a slave to righteousness?
