### Question     
Why did the Jews put Jesus on the cross?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head and slapped Him in the face. 

+ The Jews shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!!" 

+ Jesus carried His own cross, went out to the place of the Skull. There they crucified Him. 

+ Jesus entrusted His mother to the disciple He loved. 

+ Not one of His bones will be broken. 

+ Jesus' disciple Joseph took His body away and laid it in a new tomb. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Pilate wanted to release Jesus but crucified Him instead because the pressure from the Jews. We often face difficult decisions. What is my principle in making decisions? How are my decisions pleasing to God?
