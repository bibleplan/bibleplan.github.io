{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 

+ The king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. The field commander slandered against Judah. 

+ When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the Lord. He sent his men to the prophet Isaiah. 

+ Isaiah comforted Hezekiah's men. 

+ Hezekiah prayed to the Lord. 

+ Isaiah prophesied woe would come to the king of Assyria for his pride. The angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. 

+ The king of Assyria was killed by his sons. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord reminded us that: "Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it." Have I learned what the Lord has done through Bible and know how he loves me through my own experiences? Contemplate on this and give thanks to the Lord.
