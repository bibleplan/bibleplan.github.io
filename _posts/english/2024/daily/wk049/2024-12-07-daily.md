### Question     
What cured Hezekiah's illness? 

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord. 

+ The word of the Lord came to Isaiah: "Go and tell Hezekiah, I will add fifteen years to your life and I will defend this city." 

+ Hezekiah recovered and wrote song in giving thanks to the Lord. 

+ Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of his illness and recovery. 

+ Isaiah prophesized the house of Hezekiah would be carried off to Babylon. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - In Hezekiah's song of thanks, people's lives are in the hand of the Lord. How do I see my own life? Where is God's authority in my heart?
