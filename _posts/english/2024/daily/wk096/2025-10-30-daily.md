### Question     
What is the work of God's servant?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Elders and the overseers must be godly, blameless, hold firmly to the truth, can encourage as well as refute others. 

+ With sound doctrine and clear explanation, encourage and rebuke, and help others to live a godly life that glorifies God. 

+ Living godly life is the command from our gracious God, our savior. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - A life that holds firmly on truth and blameless is what God asks of all believers. Even for those who are not serving as elders or overseers, God asks the mature believers to teach and encourage others by sound doctrine, and to be responsible to refute those who oppose to it. How am I tirelessly learning the truth in my daily life? 

+ **Integrity** - What is a blameless life? How does today's passage tell us to see whether one is blameless? God not only asks the elders and overseers to live blameless lives but of all believers (Philippians 2:15, 1 Thessalonians 5:23, 2 Peter 3:14.) Think about the meaning of blameless. How shall I live blamelessly?
