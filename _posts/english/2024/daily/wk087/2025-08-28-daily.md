### Question     
How should our attitude be toward our brothers and sisters in Christ?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Accept those whose faith are weak. Do not judge. Act in love. Do not cause others to stumble. Bear with the failings of the weak. 

+ Serve Lord Jesus Christ in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What matters in the Kingdom of God as described in verses 14:17-18? How does accepting the differences of the others relate to the life in Kingdom of God? 

+ **Community** - Think about how Jesus Christ accepts us while we are still sinners. What is real acceptance when we face others? Think about how Jesus Christ bears our weaknesses and our failings. How should we bear the failings of the others?
