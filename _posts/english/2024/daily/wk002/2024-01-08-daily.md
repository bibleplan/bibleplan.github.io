### Question     
How did God call and protect Abram, the one He selected?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The seventh segment of Adam and Eve's family history, Terah's family. Mainly the story of his son, Abram. 

+ Abram followed God's calling and left Ur. Abram's wife Sarai was unable to bear child. God promised Abram land, offspring, and nation. Despite Abram's lie, God kept His promise and protected Sarai to bring forth the offspring He has promised. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - From God's calling of Abram, we can see the calling to every Christians. Do I have faith to answer His calling? 

+ **Integrity** - Even Abram, the father of all faith, had moments of weakness and lied in Egypt. But God did not give up on him. Am I willing to lean on God to strengthen me when I'm weak?
