### Question     
How did God promise Abram of descendants?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The story of promise continues. God's covenant with Abram on his descendants. 

+ God promised Abram that he would have descendants too numerous to count and would return to the promised land. Despite the promise, Abram and Sarai attempted to conceive with their own effort and went their own way. Even in human's weakness, God is still faithful in His promise. His love went beyond Abram to take care the suffering Hagar. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Although Hagar was a slave, she was still in God's care. What encouragement and comfort does her story give me today? 

+ **Integrity** - Despite the promise of God, Abram and Sarai often lacked patience and attempted to do things on their own. Have I or am I waiting impatiently? What does the story of Abram and Sarai remind me of?
