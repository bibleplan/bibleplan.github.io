### Question     
How did the Lord judge Jerusalem?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Nebuchadnezzar and all his army were fighting against Jerusalem, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord: "I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down." 

+ King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. All the officials and people who entered into this covenant changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again. 

+ The Lord said: "You have not obeyed me, so I proclaim you to fall by the sword, plague, and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth." 

+ The Lord used the Rekabites' obedience as example to rebuke Israel for their disobedience. 

+ For Rekabites have obeyed the command of their forefather, Jehonadab son of Rekab will never fail to have a descendant to serve the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - As soon as the danger is past, all of Judah changed their minds and took back the salves they had freed. How does this remind me of my integrity? How does it reflect my own sin?
