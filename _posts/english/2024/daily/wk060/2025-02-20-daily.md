### Question     
How does God treat the false prophets?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord rebukes the Israelite proverb: "The days go by and every vision comes to nothing." The Lord will put an end to this proverb for when the days are near, all visions will be fulfilled. 

+ The words of the Lord will no longer be delayed, whatever He said will be fulfilled. 

+ The Lord commanded Ezekiel to prophesy against the prophets of Israel, woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing! 

+ The Lord's hand would be against the prophets who saw false visions and utter lying divinations. 

+ The Lord commanded Ezekiel to prophesy against the daughters of those who prophesy out of their own imagination for they disheartened the righteous with their lies and encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways to save their lives. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - The false prophets prophesy out of their own imaginations. What does this mean for today's Christians? How do I know God's will? How may I testify for God?
