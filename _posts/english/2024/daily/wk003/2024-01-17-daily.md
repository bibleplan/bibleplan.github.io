### Question     
What was the end of Abraham's lifelong journey in God's promise?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The theme on God's promise to Abraham came to an end with his passing. 

+ Abraham asked his senior servant to find a wife for his son Isaac. With God lead the way, he found Laban and brought Rebekah back to marry Isaac. Abraham took another wife, died at a good-old age of 175, and left everything to Isaac. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Before Rebekah knew anything, God was already working to send Abraham's senior servant to find her. Think and thank God for what He has done for me in my life. 

+ **Fidelity** - The senior servant was faithful to Abraham's trust and sought God's will. When he saw Rebekah as God's chosen wife for Isaac, he testified in front of Laban's family and did not linger. Do I serve with the same fidelity? Am I lacking in any area?
