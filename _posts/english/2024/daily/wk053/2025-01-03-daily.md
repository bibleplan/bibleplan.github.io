### Question     
Why did God say the city of Jerusalem must be punished?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Warned the people of Benjamin to flee from Jerusalem, for disaster looms out of the north, even terrible destruction. 

+ The Lord declared the city of Jerusalem must be punished. It must take warning as it is filled with oppression. 

+ Let enemies glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine, because they have not listened to God's words and have rejected His law. 

+ An army is coming from the land of the north, armed with bow and spear to attack Zion. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord says to the Judah: "Ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls." But they wont walk in it. Why didn't they choose the Lord's way? What ways am I choosing today instead of the Lord's way and therefore unable to find peace? 

+ **Fidelity** - The Judah "From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit. They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. 'Peace, peace,' they say, when there is no peace." We as God's servant today how much awareness do we have with the realities and the needs of the world? How may I face the injustice with grace and honesty?
