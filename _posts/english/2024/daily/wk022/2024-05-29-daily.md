What happened after Abimelek, a son of Gideon, was crowned king?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Gideon's son Abimelek crowned himself as king. He murdered his seventy brothers and only the youngest, Jotham, escaped. Jotham shouted to citizen of Shechem to warn them that they would be consumed by fire. 

+ Animosity came between Abimelek and citizen of Shechem. Three years later, Abimelek was killed by a millstone dropped by a woman on a tower while attacking Thebez. 

+ After Abimelek, God raised up Tola and Jair as judges. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - We all wish God to punish as soon as possible the evil doers such as Abimelek. However, God gave him three years. We are all sinners, under God's patience. Let me be grateful to God's patience and face my own weakness and sins in earnest.  

+ **Fidelity** - Gideon appeared to be very successful with his victory over the Midianites. But, he was a complete failure in raising his son Abimelek. What have I been lacking in raising my children to walk God's path?
