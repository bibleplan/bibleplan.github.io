### Question     
What nations surrounding Israel did David defeat?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God gave victories to David over the surrounding nations. David dedicated to the Lord the gold, silver, and bronze articles he had plundered from the nations. 

+ David was king over Israel and acted righteously. 

+ David brought Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan and showed him God's kindness. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God gave David victories over the nations. Some of them weren't driven out by the Israelites when they first entered the land of Canaan. David dedicated the gold, silver, and bronze articles to God. Compare to Saul when God commanded him to drive out the Amalekites, how was David's relationship to God different from Saul's? How should I seek God's will in the works of my daily life?   

+ **Community** - David wanted to "show God's kindness" toward Mephibosheth and took him as his own son. What standard shall we adhere to in loving our fellow Christians? How may we show God's kindness?
