### Question     
How did God give Ai to Israelites through Joshua's wisdom?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God helped Joshua to capture and destroy Ai through a wise military strategy. 

+ The fall of both Jericho and Ai were God's deeds. One was through His wonderous miracle, the other was through the mind of a man. It helps us to see from these two battles how God accomplishes through different means. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God forgave the Israelites and led them to victory after Achan confessed. With our confessions, God gives us the peace which transcends all understanding through the precious blood of Jesus Christ. Am I still struggling with my past sins? Let me look up to the Cross of Christ and turn my guilt into gratitude for His salvation and the will to live out the new life He gave me. 

+ **Fidelity** - God helped the Israelites to capture Ai through Joshua's strategy. Am I willing to let God use my God given talent, resource, and energy to serve Him for His purpose?
