### Question     
What decisions did the council in Jerusalem make?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Escaping death, apostles continued to preach gospel to build the disciples. 

+ Completed the first missionary trip. Apostles described the wonders God had done through them and how Gentiles believed. 

+ The council in Jerusalem confirmed that salvation comes through God's grace and stopped enforcing rules that are irrelevant to the faith. 

+ Began the second missionary trip with Timothy joined. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Some of the people from Judea wanted the Gentile believers in Antioch to be circumcised or would not recognize them as been saved. Do I have prejudice against believers of different culture background? 

+ **Fidelity** - After being almost killed by stoning, Paul continued to preach gospel. What does this remind me where the apostles put gospel preaching at higher priority than their own lives?
