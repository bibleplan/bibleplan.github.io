### Question     
How did Isaiah rebuke the people of Judah and Jerusalem?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 

+ Isaiah rebuked the people that they have forsaken the Lord; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. 

+ The Lord dislikes meaningless offerings and hates worthless assemblies. 

+ Encourage people to wash and make themselves clean. Take away evil deeds; stop doing wrong. Learn to do right; seek justice. 

+ The faithful city has become a prostitute! Dwell in her the murderers! Zion will be delivered with justice, but rebels and sinners will both be broken. 

+ In the last days the mountain of the Lord's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What does the Lord dislike and hate? What does this remind me of how I worship the Lord? 

+ **Integrity** - The words Isaiah used to rebuke the people for forsaking the Lord are shocking. Do I need the same warnings so that I don't sin like the Israelites at the time?
