### Question     
Why did John write the Book of Revelation?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ John wrote the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, to make it known and to testify everything he saw. 

+ John wrote to the seven churches in the province of Asia. 

+ Jesus is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him. 

+ The Lord says: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty." 

+ Among the seven golden lampstands was someone like a son of man. 

+ He said: "I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God is the Alpha and the Omega, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty. I as a child of the eternal creator, how may I use properly my time on earth?
