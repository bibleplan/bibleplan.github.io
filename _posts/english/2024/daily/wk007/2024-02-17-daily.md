### Question     
What did God do after giving the ten commandments and the civil laws?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The last segment of the covenant ceremony on Mount Sinai to complete the process started in Exodus 19. 

+ God made covenant with Israelites to help them learn to experience His glory and assurance through worship and ceremony. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - They said, "Everything the Lord has said we will do." God's covenant with people is precious. Do I treasure His word and faithfully obey His commands? 

+ **Community** - They ate and drank. This was the banquet at the covenant ceremony. It was an indication that the Israelites had great relationship with God. Do I often experience close relationship with God and able to share the great wealth from Him?
