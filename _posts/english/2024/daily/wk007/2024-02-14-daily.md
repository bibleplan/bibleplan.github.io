### Question     
How did Moses fight the Amalekites and how did he govern the Israelites?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Moses commanded Joshua to fight the Amalekites and devised organizational structure to govern the Israelites. 

+ Israelites won the war with Amalekites because Moses held up in his hands the staff of God with help from Aaron and Hur. 

+ Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, helped him to build the organizational structure for governance. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Israelites were wining when Moses raise his hands. Losing when he grew tired. It was with Aaron and Hur's help that Moses was able to keep his hands up. Do I value my fellow Christians' contributions when serving the Lord? 

+ **Fidelity** - Besides faith, wisdom is also needed when serving. Moses distributed the responsibilities, so he would not become the bottle neck. How am I co-working with my fellow Christians as a team when serving the Lord?
