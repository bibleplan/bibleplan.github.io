### Question     
Why did the Lord's vineyard yield bad fruit?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After judgment, the branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, the Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; He will cleanse by a spirit of judgment. 

+ In the vineyard on a fertile hillside, He looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit. 

+ The vineyard of the Lord is the nation of Israel, and the people of Judah are the vines he delighted in. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed. 

+ Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land. Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes. 

+ The Lord will whistle for those at the ends of the earth, to come to plunder the people. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Do I find in today's church the tyranny and injustice in the vineyard parable? Am I being insensitive? What is our current situation?
