### Question     
Who were the cities of refuge established for? What is the proper way of going to battle in the eyes of our Lord?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God established the cities of refuge for those who killed unintentionally. However, those who willfully kill would be put to death. 

+ Any crime or offense needs two or three witnesses to convict the accused. No false witness is allowed. 

+ Do not be afraid when going to battle. However, those who have just build a house, just planted vineyard, just got married may stay behind. Anyone who is afraid may stay behind. Offer peace to enemy first, engage in battle only if they refuse. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God established the cities of refuge because He knows that people would avenge on those who harmed them unintentionally. Have I forgiven those who might have hurt me? 

+ **Integrity** - God is fully considerate of those who have just built, planted, and married to allow them to stay behind. Am I being considerate of others and put myself in their shoes?
