### Question     
How did Jesus reveal His identity?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In Caesarea Philippi, Peter said to Jesus "You are the Messiah." Jesus predicted His death and resurrection for the first time. 

+ The price to pay for being a disciple is to deny themselves and take up their crosses and follow Jesus. 

+ Jesus went up to a high mountain and transfigured. He stood with Moses and Elijah. 

+ Disciples couldn't drive out the demon from a possessed boy revealed the unbelieving generation. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Peter's spiritual life seemed to have fallen to bottom of the valley when Jesus predicted his denials compared to the time he proclaimed Him as the Messiah. Is my spiritual life high on the peak of the mount or in the bottom of the valley? Am I following God's will or my own desires? 

+ **Identity** - Jesus taught us to deny ourselves and take up our crosses to follow Him as the only way to receive true life. That is, we need to give up ourselves to gain ourselves. What do I need to give up today? What have I received already?
