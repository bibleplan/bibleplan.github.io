### Question     
How are the lands allotted to the tribes of Israel?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ There is water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east. 

+ The water becomes a river, fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river, their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing. 

+ Allot as inheritance the land according to the tribes of Israel. 

+ Listed by tribes the land allotted to them. 

+ The land to be used for city, for houses, and for pastureland. 

+ What remains on both sides of the area formed by the sacred portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince. 

+ The gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What differences are there between the names of the gates listed here and in Revelation 21:12-13? How am I seeing God's faithfulness and love toward His people?
