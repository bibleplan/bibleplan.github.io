### Question     
What areas of my life need to be renewed?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Those who reconnect with God would have a life different from their former way of life. This is because the old self is corrupted by deceitful desires, but the new self is created to be like God. 

+ We are children of light in the Lord and shall live in the light (goodness, righteousness, and truth) as well as to find out what pleases the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The Bible teaches us that connecting with God brings out a renewed life. Have I recently experienced a transformation of my life brought about by my renewed heart? We are often motivated by the decision to change and experience the joy of change. However, we sometimes forget the change and go back to business as usual. It is a long process to transform to the new life. How should I build a regular habit of devotion, immersion in God's word and His light to truly transform my life to have a God like character?
