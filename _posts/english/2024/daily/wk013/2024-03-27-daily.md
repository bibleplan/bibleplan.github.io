### Question     
How did the Israelites follow God's lead?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Israelites encamped or moved on as God commanded. 

+ God gave the Israelites two silver trumpets at the foot of Mount Sinai to signal their movements. The silver trumpets and the cloud presented unified direction to the Israeli people. In the last days, God will also send his angels to sound trumpets to gather His people (Mat. 24:31; Rev. 8-9) 

+ Israelites started their passage to the promised land from the desert of Sinai a year and a month and 20 days after they have come out of Egypt. A journey that took 38 years to complete is covered in 10:11-22:1. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The ark of covenant was at the very front leading the way to find a restful place for the Israelites (10:33). During the day, the cloud covered them from the burning sun. It might look like a lot of hard work to follow God but it is always filled with His mercy and protection. Think about the love and care He gave me as well the encouragements this passage gives me. 

+ **Identity** - When the cloud lifted, the Israelites set out. When the cloud settled, they stayed. They sometimes would stay at one place for a long while. Sometimes they would move on the next day. When the trumpets sound, they followed. Following God means not following our own desires, no matter what. What am I following today, my own desire or God?
