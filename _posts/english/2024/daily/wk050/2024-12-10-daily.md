### Question     
What has the Lord done?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ With whom will you compare God? To what image will you liken Him? 

+ God brings out the starry host one by one. 

+ God will lead all Israel. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. 

+ God said to Israel: "You are my servant; I have chosen you and have not rejected you." So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. 

+ Idols, you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless; whoever chooses you is detestable. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint. Where do I seek strength? How may I be strengthened by God?
