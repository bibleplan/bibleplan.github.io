### Question     
How may we praise the Lord for what He is doing?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The God of Israel is the first and the last; apart from Him there is no God. 

+ Do not tremble, do not be afraid. You are my witnesses. 

+ All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. 

+ Sing for joy, you heavens, for the Lord has redeemed Jacob, He displays His glory in Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - No idol worshiper has the knowledge or understanding that a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself, or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?" What idols am I still worshiping?
