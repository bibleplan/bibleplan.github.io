### Question     
Why did the Lord raise up Cyrus?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ I am the Lord, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself. 

+ This is what the Lord says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him. 

+ I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free. 

+ Turn to the Lord and be saved, all of us ends of the earth; for He is God, and there is no other. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Does the clay say to the potter, "What are you making?" Does your work say, "The potter has no hands?" We shall obey under God's sovereignty knowing He had created us and is the source of our peace. What doubt do I still have for Him and wondering why something happens not to my liking? Call out to God and try to accept His sovereignty over that "thing."
