How did God give people hope in His righteous judgment?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of God's pasture! 

+ God will raise up for David a righteous Branch. 

+ Concerning the false prophets and their punishments. 

+ Those who are cynical of the prophets will be punished. 

+ The Lord likened those Judah who would be looked after and receive His grace to the good figs. He also likened the Judah king and the rest of the Judah who would become abhorrent, be reproached and ridiculed by the nations to the bad figs. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God saved a remnant from the exiles of the Judah, to give them a heart to know Him, and bring them back to the promised land, to be His people, and return to Him with all their heart. God saved us by His grace. How may I know God more each day of my life?
