### Question     
What were the parables Jesus used to explain the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus used seven parables to explain the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven: The parable of the sower, the parable of the weeds, the parable of the muster seed, the parable of the yeast, the parable of the hidden treasure, the parable of the pearl, and the parable of the net. 

+ Jesus explained to the disciples the reason he spoke the parables to the crowds. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Even though we did not witness with our own eyes the miracle Jesus performed and did not hear with our own ears what Jesus spoke, but we are ever so blessed with God's word and the presence of the Holy Spirit. We ought to cherish what God has given us, study Bible every day, pray and obey to guidance of the Holy Spirit.  

+ **Identity** - How is the seed from the Kingdom of Heaven germinating in my heart? Pray to God and ask Him to soften my heart, remove the thorn and the rock, to produce crop a hundred times!
