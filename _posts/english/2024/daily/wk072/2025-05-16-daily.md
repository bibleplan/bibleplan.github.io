### Question     
How did Peter come to know Jesus' true identity?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Led by God, Peter came to know Jesus' true identity, but he did not understand when Jesus talked about His death and resurrection. Jesus transfigured before Peter, John, and James with Moses and Elijah appeared beside Him. They were covered with bright cloud and God said: "This is my son." Peter gotten to know Jesus deeper. 

+ Jesus predicted His death and resurrection twice. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Peter did not come to know Jesus by his own rationale but by the guidance and revelation from the Holy Spirit. We, too, cannot know God without the Holy Spirit's guidance and revelation. Ask God to help me to know Him better and to love Him deeper each day!
