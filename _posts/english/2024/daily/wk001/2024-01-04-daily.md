### Question     
What is the result of sin?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ This is the third segment of Adam and Eve's family, the account of Noah's family. 

+ Like Enoch, Noah walked with God. The flood was brought by the sin of the world. Noah was saved because of his righteousness and submission. The flood renewed the world, God established new covenant with Noah and commanded him to "be fruitful and increase in number." The sons of Noah continued to sin but Shem was blessed. 

+ A race was selected from the sinful world and brought hope that the final salvation will come through them. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Am I drifting in the sinful world like everyone else or live in God's light as His children like Noah? 

+ **Fidelity** - It seemed that Noah had an impossible task at hand but "Noah did everything just as God commanded him." Am I facing some tasks that seems to be impossible? Am I following His command?
