### Question     
How did the man live when God created the world?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Genesis 2:4-4:26 is the first of the ten segments of Adam and Eve's family history. 

+ God created man and put him in the Garden of Eden. God also made Eve out of Adam's rib for them to help each other and become one (2:4-25); The serpent deceived man and caused him to be separated from God (3:1-24); Man's downfall continued with Cain's murder of his brother Abel to Lamech's arrogance. Only then, people began to call on the name of the Lord (4:1-26.)  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - What does the downfall of Adam and Eve tell me? Am I doing things not to God's liking due to my own pride and desire? 

+ **Identity** - Am I willing to call on God's name and face my own heart?
