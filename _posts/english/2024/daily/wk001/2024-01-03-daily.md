How was the relationship between Adam and Eve's offspring and God developed?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The second segment of Adam and Eve's Family history is the account their other son, Seth and his family. 

+ Seth had Adam's image; Adam died; Enoch walked faithfully with God; Noah "He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands..."; Because of their wickedness, God "...will wipe from the face of the earth ... the human race ..." But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.  

+ Contrast with Cain's family. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ Walk with God - Am I like Enoch, pray and live by God's word? What is impeding me to walk with God? 

+ **Integrity** - How much of my thoughts are good? Are evil? How can I keep my thoughts good and pure?
