### Question     
What were people's reactions to Jesus?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus appointed the twelve to be with Him and to be sent out to preach.

+ Whoever does God's will is His brother and sister. 

+ The parable of sower is to teach all to listen and to act. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus said those who do God's will are His brothers, sisters, and mother. We are a member of Jesus' family for our faith in Him. Am I living a life as God's children? What is impeding my being identified as such? 

+ **Integrity** - Are the troubling thoughts of worldly worries, deception of money, or personal desires blocking the way of God to make my life unfruitful? Pray and ask God to help me remove the thoughts of these troubling matters.
