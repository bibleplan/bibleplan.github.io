### Question     
What power did Jesus display and what were the Pharisees’ hostilities against Jesus?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ Five incidents and the hostilities from Pharisees and teachers of the law are depicted in this section. 

+ The events are not in chronological order and each contains an important message from Jesus. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – As the Pharisees were hostile against Jesus, I might encounter in my service those who are hostile and have to take a stance for my belief. What can I learn from Jesus’ attitude and His way of treating those who were against Him? 

+ **Fidelity** – Jesus said He did not come to call the righteous but the sinners. What does this reveal to me? How am I treating the sinners around me? Am I capable of loving them as Jesus does? Why?
