### Question     
How did Paul testify for the truth in front of King Agrippa?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul was granted appeal to Caesar. 

+ King Agrippa acknowledged Paul's innocence. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Paul explained with the truth, not seeking excuses, whether in front of King Agrippa or Festus. When rebuked while I'm preaching, can I stick to the truth? 

+ **Fidelity** - Paul would have been released by King Agrippa if he hadn't repealed to Caesar. However, Paul's intention was to proclaim gospel in Rome, not his personal freedom. What is my priority when I weigh the pros and cons, my personal benefit or God's commission?
