### Question     
How did Israel commit sin?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Hosea showed his love to his wife again. 
+ Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the Lord their God. 
+ There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land. Therefore, the land dries up and all who live in it waste away. 
+ People are destroyed from lack of knowledge. 
+ Prostitution, old wine and new wine take away their understanding. They are led astray and unfaithful to their God. 
+ Though you, Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty. 
+ Judgment will come to Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. However, the Lord would pasture them like lambs in a meadow. The Lord is our shepherd, only He can give us our true identity and true relationship with Him. Am I in the meadow like His lambs?
