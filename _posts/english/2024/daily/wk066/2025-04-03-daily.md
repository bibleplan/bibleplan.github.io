### Question     
Ephraim is blighted for what reason?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ephraim is blighted, their root is withered, they yield no fruit. 
+ Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself. Their heart is deceitful. The Lord will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones. 
+ They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field. 
+ Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the Lord, until he comes and showers his righteousness on you. 
### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The Lord wants us to sow righteousness for ourselves so we may reap the fruit of unfailing love. It is now the time to seek the Lord. Am I treating others and myself with justice? Do I do everything by seeking the Lord?
