### Question     
How was Daniel different? 

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ An eagle is over the house of the Lord because the people have broken the Lord's covenant and rebelled against His law. 
+ With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction. Samaria, throw out your calf-idol! The Lord's anger burns against them. 
+ Israel has forgotten their Maker and built palaces; But God will send fire on their cities that will consume their fortresses. 
+ Threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people. They will not remain in the Lord's land; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Israel has forgotten their Maker and built palaces; But God will send fire. Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. For things I build, do I lean on God or by my own effort?
