{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus predicted His own death and gave sight to the blind. 

+ Through Zacchaeus the Tax Collector, Jesus explained the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost. 

+ Through the parable of the minas, Jesus explained the importance of wisely put to work our gifts. 

+ Jesus rode donkey into Jerusalem. Jesus' sorrow for Jerusalem. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus said He came to seek and to save the lost. Am I unable to let go of my past sins and failures? How does Jesus' word help me realize my value and worth? 

+ **Fidelity** - When the servant said to the master that he reaps what he did not sow, the servant looked down upon the mina his master entrusted to him. Am I able to see the gifts the Lord has entrusted to me and am willing to be used by Him to become the blessing of others?
