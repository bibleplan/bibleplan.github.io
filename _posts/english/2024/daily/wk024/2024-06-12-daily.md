### Question     
What was it like when Samuel grew up?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Although Eli was a priest, his sons were scoundrels and brought sins into the Israelites. Through the mouth of a man of God, the judgment to Eli's family was declared. 

+ Samuel ministered before the Lord when he was still a boy. He found favor with the Lord and was chosen to be the new high priest. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - What does it mean that Eli honored his two sons more than God? Contrast Eli's attitude in educating his sons to Hannah's dedication of Samuel to God. What does it remind me of? 

+ **Fidelity** - Eli's two sons were the Lord's priest, but they did not know the Lord. Samuel, on the other hand, was young and not yet knowing the Lord but served the Lord faithfully, grew in favor of the Lord, and also with man. Compare Eli, his two sons, and Samuel their attitudes in serving the Lord. What can I learn from it?
