### Question     
Why does Jesus say He is the bread of life?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus feeds five thousand with two small barley loaves and two small fish with left over filled twelve baskets. 

+ Jesus walks on the water. 

+ Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life. 

+ Jesus says, I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 

+ The Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven." Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" 

+ The words Jesus has spoken-they are full of the Spirit and life. 

+ Many of His disciples turned back but Simon Peter knew Jesus has the words of eternal life, is the Holy One of God. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus teaches, do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life. How do I understand this? How does it affect my daily life?
