### Question     
What was the history of Israel to the east of the Jordan river?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The land settled by the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 

+ God delivered the Hagrites to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 

+ The two and half tribes were unfaithful to God and went into exile. 

+ The descendants of Levi. 

+ The men David put in charge of the music in the house of the Lord after the ark came to rest. 

+ Aaron and his descendants presented offerings on the altar of burnt offering and on the altar of incense in connection with all that was done in the Most Holy Place. 

+ The locations of the settlements allotted to Aaron's descendants as their territory. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What was the secret to victory for Ruben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh when they were outnumbered by their enemy? Why did they later end up in exile? How do these accounts remind me? What determines our success or failure? 

+ **Fidelity** - The responsibility of Aaron's descendants was to serve God according to Moses' law. How does God command me to serve? Am I following His command?
