### Question     
How did the Lord avenge against Babylon for Israel?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord would bring devastation to Babylon to avenge her abuse of the Israelites. 

+ The Lord would stir up the spirit of a destroyer against Babylon and the people of Leb Kamai. 

+ Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the Lord Almighty. Flee from Babylon! Run for your lives! 

+ The Lord has stirred up the kings of the Medes, because His purpose is to destroy Babylon. 

+ The Lord would dry up Babylon's sea and make her springs dry. Babylon would be a heap of ruins, a place where no one lives. 

+ Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon. He asked Seraiah to read all these words aloud. 

+ When finished reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - What was written about Babylon's prosperity and standing in this chapter? But, Babylon fell to disgrace because she did not put a leash on her desires. How am I putting to proper use of the gift and privilege from God?
