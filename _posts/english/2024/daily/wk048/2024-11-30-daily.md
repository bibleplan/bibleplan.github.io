### Question     
How does God gather the remnant of Israel?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ They will sing in the land of Judah: "Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal." 

+ People will enter their rooms and shut the doors behind them; hide themselves for a little while until His wrath has passed by. 

+ The Lord will watch over the vineyard, water it continually, guard it day and night so that no one may harm it. 

+ In that day, the Lord will gather up Israel, one by one. 

+ In that day, the trumpet will sound. Those who were in exile will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord will establish peace for us, so we must lean on His name. Where does my peace come from? If I have fear, where does that come from?
