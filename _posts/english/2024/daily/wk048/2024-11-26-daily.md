### Question     
What was the fate of the nations?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ The prophecy came in the year King Ahaz died. 

+ Disaster will come to the Philistines. It will be destroyed by famine and survivors slayed. 

+ Moab is ruined and destroyed in a night. 

+ Advise the Moabites to give tribute to the king of Zion. The Moabites will wail together for Moab. Lament and grieve. 

+ Damascus will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins. 

+ The remnant of Israel will return to the Lord. 

+ The Lord will rebuke the people, for this is the portion of those who loot, the lot of those who plunder. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – The Israelites forgot the Lord, His salvation, the rock, and therefore without harvest. Have I forgotten the source of my strength? How may I be strengthened by the Lord?
