### Question     
What was God's plan for Isaac's other son Esau?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The ninth segment of Adam's family history. Realization of God's promise to Esau. 

+ Esau is Edom. Edom was ruled by Kings before Israelites. The sons of Edom were living in the promised land but Esau took them to Seir. Jacob's sons except Benjamin were all born outside of the promised land but he lead them back to it. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Esau was strong and Jacob was weak on the surface. However, God's blessing is not superficial nor material. What is my focus when I lead my family to follow the Lord?
