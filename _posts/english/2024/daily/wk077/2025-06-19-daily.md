### Question     
What may one become a brother of Jesus?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus uses the parable of sower to depict the difference in people's reactions to the truth. 

+ Jesus said: "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice." 

+ Jesus calmed the storm and drove out the demons into the pigs. 

+ The woman who bled for years was healed for her faith. Jairus' daughter was raised from dead for his faith. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The woman who bled for years did not dare to ask Jesus directly but touched His cloak from behind wished to be healed. Can I come to Jesus without reservation and ask for His grace, for I have faith in Him? 

+ **Integrity** - Jesus said: "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear." Am I listening carefully to the voice of the Holy Spirit?
