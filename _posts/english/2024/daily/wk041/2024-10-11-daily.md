### Question     
How were the Israelites dispersed in Jerusalem and other cities?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem. The rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten of them to live in Jerusalem, while the remaining nine were to stay in their own towns. 

+ The people of Judah and the Benjamites lived in the villages with their fields. 

+ The account of the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel. 

+ At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the people celebrated joyfully with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres. 

+ Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites, contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Who must live in Jerusalem? Those leaders have the burden of protecting the people's safety. What can I learn from that? 

+ **Fidelity** - What did the Israelites emphasize on at the dedication of the wall? Do I view importantly the holidays in remembrance of the Lord Jesus Christ, such as the Good Friday and Easter? Why?
