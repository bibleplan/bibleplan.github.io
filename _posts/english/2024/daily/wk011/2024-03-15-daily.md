### Question     
What are other requirements for priests?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The priests are set apart from the rest of the people for God. The requirements for the priests are even higher. God set clear priority to their duty and daily lives. 

+ Holy objects are set apart for God. Israelites needed to keep these objects holy. 

+ The phrases "I am the Lord who makes them holy" or similar appeared 6 times and "I am the Lord" appeared 6 times, as well. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God set high standards for the priests. How does today's passage remind me that I am a chosen royal priest? 

+ **Fidelity** - What's my priority comparing my tasks at hand and serving God? What do the requirements God set for the priests remind me of?
