### Question     
How to love one another?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Christians ought to keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters. Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers. Keep our lives free from the love of money. 

+ We ought to help and take care willingly those who are in prison. 

+ We shall entrust ourselves to God with faith because He will not leave us and will never forsake us. 

+ Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. 

+ God redeems us, equips us with everything good for doing His will, and He works in us what is pleasing to Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Bible teaches us to love one another as brothers and sisters. Am I filled with love in my life with my Christian brothers and sisters? Am I helping them to bear the sufferings that they might have?
