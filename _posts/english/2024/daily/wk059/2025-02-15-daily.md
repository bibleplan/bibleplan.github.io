### Question     
How did God command Ezekiel to prophesy Israel's exile?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord commanded Ezekiel to shave his head as an analogy to Jerusalem's rebellion of God's laws and decrees. 

+ The Lord commanded Ezekiel to prophesy against the mountains of Israel that His was about to bring a sword against them. 

+ The Lord would spare some, for some of the Israelites would escape the sword when they were scattered among the lands and nations. Those who escape would remember God and repent. 

+ The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel, God would judge against Israel according to her conduct and repay her for all her detestable practices. 

+ Israel made detestable idols in the temple. God would give their wealth as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth. 

+ God commanded Ezekiel to prepare chains as a sign of Israel's exile. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God judge the people to let them know "their silver and gold will not be able to deliver them, will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs, for it has caused them to stumble into sin." How do I see my own wealth? How should I make use of my wealth?
