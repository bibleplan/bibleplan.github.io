### Question     
Why does the Lord save the sinners?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God declares to His people their rebellion and to the descendants of Jacob their sins. 

+ If on the day of your fasting, you do as you please, in quarreling and strife. Is this the kind of fast God have chosen for people to humble themselves? 

+ If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please, then you will find your joy in the Lord. 

+ The arm of the Lord is not too short to save, but your iniquities have separated you from your God. 

+ He saw that there was no one, no one to intervene, so his own arm achieved salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him. 

+ The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - The fasting that pleases God is to share the food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter. When you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood. When I serve, do I serve with all my heart and all my mind? Let me remember that when I act with such righteousness and mercy, the Lord's glory would be behind me in support!
