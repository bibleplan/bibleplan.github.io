### Question     
How does God's salvation spread to the end of the world?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ For Zion, the prophet will not keep silent till her vindication shines out like the dawn. 

+ No longer will they call you Deserted. But you will be called Hephzibah, for the Lord will take delight in you, and your land will be married. 

+ The Lord has made proclamation to the ends of the earth: "Say to Daughter Zion, 'See, your Savior comes! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.'" 

+ The Lord who proclaim victory, mighty to save, will trodden the enemies. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord call Israel Hephzibah also calls us the same as He takes delight in us. The people of the Lord shall shine on earth and be His ambassador of grace. How may I live out the life that is pleasing to the Lord?
