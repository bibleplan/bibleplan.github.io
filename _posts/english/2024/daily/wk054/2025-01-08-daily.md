### Question     
How would the Lord ruin the pride of Judah?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 

+ These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts. 

+ The prophet wept in secret: "Because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the Lord's flock will be taken captive." 

+ The cities in the Negev will be shut up. All Judah will be carried into exile, carried completely away. 

+ The Lord declares: "This is your lot, the portion I have decreed for you." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - "Judah refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt! For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me," declares the Lord, "to be my people for my renown and praise and honor." We too, changed from rebellious through repentance to become His people. What am I doing today to glorify and give praise to God?
