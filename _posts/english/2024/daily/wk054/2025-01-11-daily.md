### Question     
What example did the Lord use to show Israel of His wrath?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord's word came to Jeremiah told him to go down to the potter's house. Israel to the Lord as the clay in the potter's hand, the Lord can do to them as the potter does to the clay. 

+ The Lord is preparing a disaster for Israel and devising a plan against them. So turn from each's evil ways and reform your ways and your actions. 

+ The prophet prayed to the Lord to save him from the evil plans of his accusers. 

+ The Lord said to Jeremiah to buy a clay jar from a potter then proclaim His word: "He will bring disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle." Then break the jar and say: "He will smash this nation and this city just as this potter's jar is smashed and cannot be repaired." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - The prophet prayed to the Lord to save him because Israel repaid good with evil and did not remember how he stood before the Lord to speak in their behalf. Have I ever been misunderstood and even got hurt? How may I call to God for His salvation?
