### Question     
How the Lord wanted the prophet to tell people His will?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah to tell the people: "Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant." 

+ To proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: "Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them." 

+ Israel and Judah have broken the covenant, so the Lord will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. 

+ Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them. 

+ The prophet brought a case before the Lord: "Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the faithless live at ease?" 

+ For all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands. But after I uproot them, I will have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The wicked, they are close to God on their lips but far from their hearts. Reflect on what comes out of my mouth with what is in my heart, do they match up? How may I ask God to help me?
