### Question     
What were the fates of the kings of the north and south, Jeroboam and Rehoboam?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ahijah foretold the disaster and downfall of the house of Jeroboam. 

+ He reigned for twenty-two years and Nadab his son succeeded him as king. 

+ Rehoboam, son of Solomon reigned in Judah for seventeen years. Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord. 

+ In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. He carried off the treasures of the temple of the Lord and the treasures of the royal palace. 

+ Rehoboam died and was buried in the City of David. Abijah his son succeeded him as king. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Prophet Ahijah pointed out to Jeroboam the consequence of his sin. Is there anyone in my life who can help point out my weaknesses? Have I listened to them? 

+ **Integrity** - Israel was strong while Solomon reigned but gradually declined in the hands of his son Rehoboam. How should I pass on the blessings to the next generation? How should I keep myself disciplined so the blessings passed onto me are not lost?
