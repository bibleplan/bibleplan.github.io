### Question     
How did the history of Samaria come about?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. He bought the hill of Samaria and built a city on the hill. Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord and sinned more than all those before him. 

+ Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over Israel twenty-two years. Ahab did more evil in the eyes of the Lord than any of those before him. He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria. Ahab also made an Asherah pole. 

+ Elijah said to Ahab, "there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word." 

+ Elijah was provided by a widow in Zarephath and he made her jar of flour and jug of oil never run out and brought her son back to life. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - What sin did Ahab commit that was more than all those before him? What idols are in my heart that are hard to remove? Let me pray to God to help me identify and remove the idols in my life. 

+ **Integrity** - What are the various ways God used to strengthen Elijah's faith? In my journey of faith, do I have any similar experience as Elijah's?
