### Question     
What did Jesus encounter when He started His ministry?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus was rejected in His hometown Nazareth when He ministered there. 

+ Jesus drove out impure spirit and healed many in Capernaum. He preached in Galilee. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The people in Nazareth did not believe Jesus because they thought they knew Him and His background. Do I have any prejudice toward the truth? Let me be humble in front of God and let His word work in me. 

+ **Fidelity** - Jesus was praised in Galilee but rejected in His hometown. Likewise, we may be met with refusal in our ministry and become other's laughingstock. Am I willing to be misunderstood like Jesus and suffer for God.
