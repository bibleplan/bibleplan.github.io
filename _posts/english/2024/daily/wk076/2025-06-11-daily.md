### Question     
Why did Luke write this gospel? Where did he start?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Luke explains the reason for writing this gospel.

+ Angel appeared to Zechariah and told him about the birth of John the Baptist. 

+ Angel appeared to Mary and told her about conceiving Jesus. 

+ Birth of John the Baptist and his father Zechariah, filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesized the coming of Messiah.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Mary had doubt about her conceiving Jesus while being a virgin, but she said: "I am the Lord's servant, may your word to me be fulfilled." How do I value my identity? Am I willing to fill my life with God's will or my own? 

+ **Identity** - Mary: "My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior." Whom does my soul glorify? Where does my spirit rejoice in?
