### Question     
What are the other instructions for the Tabernacle?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The other instructions for the Tabernacle, including the altar of incense, atonement money, basin for washing, anointing oil, incense, and craftsmen. God also wanted man to observe Sabbath. 

+ God established Tabernacle so He could dwell among His people. He established the Sabbath to indicate the Israelites are set apart and belong to Him. Building Tabernacle and observing Sabbath are the two sides of the same coin of worshiping.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God established Tabernacle to be with us, sabbath for us to rest, and set apart us to Himself. How do I sanctify myself to make myself His? 

+ **Fidelity** - God values our services of all kinds. He filled the craftsmen with His Spirit so they would have the skills and wisdom to serve Him. Do I value the gifts God has given to me to serve Him?
