### Question     
What happened down below when Moses was up in the mountain to see God?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Israelites made a golden calf and broke the covenant with God when they couldn't wait for Moses to come back from the mountain. Moses pleaded to God for forgiveness to the people so that some of them were given a new chance. 

+ Here we see God's blessings and love. Although man continued to rebel against God, He continued to keep His promises and give man opportunities to repent. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God and Moses were talking in the Tabernacle like friends. How could Moses be so close to God when he was not perfect? Besides being chosen by God, Moses also leaned on Him completely. Do I often experience God's presence and walk with Him? 

+ **Community** - Moses showed his love for his people. He pleaded for them and was willing to sacrifice for them. Am I willing to forgive and sacrifice for others?
