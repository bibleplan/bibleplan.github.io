### Question     
What was Ezekiel's responsibility as the watchman?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ When the watchman sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people, then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not heed the warning and the sword comes and takes their life, their blood will be on their own head. 

+ The Lord made Ezekiel a watchman. 

+ The Lord takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. 

+ If someone who is righteous disobeys, that person's former righteousness will count for nothing. And if someone who is wicked repents, that person's former wickedness will not bring condemnation. 

+ In the twelfth year of Israel's exile, in the tenth month on the fifth day, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to Ezekiel and said, "The city has fallen!" Ezekiel's mouth was opened in the morning and no longer silent. 

+ Those who listen but do not put into practice of what the prophet says, will be punished. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Fellow Christians watch over each other like Ezekiel watched over Israel. What should I do if I know someone who offended God? How may limbs of Christ be blessed by watching over each other? How may I watch over the world?
