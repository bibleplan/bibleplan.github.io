### Question     
What did the descendants of Israel experience in Egypt?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God is loving and faithful. He has a perfect plan for His people. He listens and cares for them. So, we lean on Him and keep hope in His plan for all who leans on Him will be brought out of darkness into light to experience His abundant blessings. 

+ God elected man to work with Him. He needs no one's help because He is omnipotent. And yet, He chooses man to work with Him so that we may experience Him. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - How did Moses feel when God first called on Him? How do I identify myself when I hesitate from answering God's calling? 

+ **Fidelity** - God always gave Moses the perfect solution each time he pushed back on His calling. Am I pushing back God's calling because I distrust my own ability to handle rather than depend on Him to supply and equip?
