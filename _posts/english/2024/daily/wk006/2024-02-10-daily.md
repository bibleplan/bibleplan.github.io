### Question     
How did God lead Israelites out of Egypt?
{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the days of Exodus, God used the pillar of cloud and pillar of fire to lead the Israelites every day so they would not get lost. 

+ It was a great challenge facing the Red Sea. Israelites experienced God's great power in His faithfulness and salvation. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Moses brought along Joseph's bones because Joseph told the Israelites: "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place." A faithful servant of God continues to testify for Him even after he dies. What can I learn from this? 

+ **Fidelity** - Israelites complained against Moses when facing the impassable Red Sea. But Moses continued to comfort them asking them to have faith in God. Moses' faith in God and positive attitude were admirable. Can I learn to have faith in God when I face difficulties in my life?
