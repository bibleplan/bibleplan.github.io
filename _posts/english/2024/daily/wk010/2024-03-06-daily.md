### Question     
What do the priests need to worry about?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Additional details on the five offerings. 
+ Priests need to be very careful about the holy objects. They cannot wear their priestly garments outside of the Tabernacle. Even the ashes from the offerings need to be taken care of according to regulation. Same attention to details needs to be paid to all things whether it is a large bull or a speck of the finest flour. 
+ God made the tribe of Levite priests forever for them to focus on serving. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God supplies His priests through all Israelites. God also supplies all those who serve Him through all His people. How does this encourage me? 
+ **Fidelity** - We are God's chosen people, are His royal priests. What does it remind me that God holds extremely high standard for priests? What can I learn from the priests' attitude toward serving and apply that to my life?
