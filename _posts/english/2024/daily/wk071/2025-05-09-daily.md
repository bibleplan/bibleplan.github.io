### Question     
What does Jesus teach about loving God and loving others?

{% include BibleLinks2024.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Serve only God (6:19-34), treat others in God pleasing ways (7:1-12), and take root in Godly life our obedience and faith (7:13-27). 

+ People were amazed as Jesus spoke with authority. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - We cannot serve both God and Money. What is our attitude when serving money? Often through different means God makes us see that when we value money more than Him we are actually serving money, although we may think otherwise. It is the distrust of God's supply and His protection that brings us worries and impedes our total reliance in God. What worries do I have? Ask God to help me lay down my worries to Him. There are many impurities in the root of my faith. Ask God Himself to purify me, to help me build the foundation of my faith on Him, the Rock. 

+ **Community** - How should I treat my family members, fellow Christians, co-workers, colleagues, and neighbors according to the teaching Do Not Judge and the golden rule of Loving Others as Yourself? (Golden rule, 7:12, so in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.)
