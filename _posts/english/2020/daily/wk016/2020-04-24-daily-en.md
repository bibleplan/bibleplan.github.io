### Question     
How did God protect the land He promised Abram?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Continue from previous day's scripture, God protected the land He promised Abram. 

+ Abram and Lot separated due to the arguments between their shepherds. Lot chose the land that looked fine but full of sin. Abram rescued Lot and people of Sodom and became the blessing of these people. 

+ Abram did not accept the gift from Melchizedek, the king of Sodom. Rather he gave a tenth of everything he owned and became the first in history to give tithe. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Abram did not accept the gift from king of Sodom but rather accepted Melchizedek's blessings and gave a tenth of his wealth to God. What do I learn from this in answering God's calling? 

+ **Community** - Abram reconciled his differences with Lot and bravely rescued him. Are there differences between myself and others? How may I reconcile with them?
