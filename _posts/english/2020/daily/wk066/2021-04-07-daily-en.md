What transpired as result of Amaziah's not being wholehearted?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Amaziah reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not wholeheartedly. 

+ Amaziah hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel but was stopped by a man of God. 

+ Amaziah led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir. He brought back the gods of the people of Seir and set them up as his own gods. 

+ Amaziah sent challenge to Jehoash king of Israel. Judah was routed by Israel. 

+ Some conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there. 

+ Uzziah reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. 

+ But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the Lord his God. He had leprosy on his forehead until the day he died. Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What was Amaziah's downfall? Where was he not wholehearted? What warning do I see in his failure? 

+ **Integrity** - Uzziah's pride came about from his successes. How may I not fall by my successes?
