### Question     
How did the church reach unit on the question of gospel to the Gentiles?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Peter explained how the Holy Spirit went into the Gentiles so that everyone understood that God's salvation is for the Gentiles as well as the Jews. 

+ Gospel spread to Antioch and a great number of Gentiles believed and turned to the Lord. Barnabas co-worked with Paul for a year, taught and brought up a great number of disciples.  

+ Led by an Angel, Peter escaped from prison miraculously. 

+ James executed, Peter imprisoned, Herod eaten by worms as he did not give glory to God. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Herod executed James and imprisoned Peter to please the Jews. Am I doing anything to please people but against God's will? Pray and ask God to help me to put Him first. 

+ **Fidelity** - Barnabas, filled with Holy Spirit, was quite reputable in Jerusalem's church. However, he was not arrogant but valued Paul's gifts and invited him to co-work together. Am I humble when I serve? Do I value my co-workers' gifts and repect their strengths?
