### Question     
How did Stephen proclaim Jesus until martyred?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God enabled Stephen to perform wonders and signs but he was falsely accused for blasphemy. 

+ Filled with Holy Spirit, Stephen declared to those in Sanhedrin that they were living in sin just like their ancestors, always resisted the Holy Spirit, prosecuted prophets, betrayed and murdered the Righteous One. 

+ Stephen martyred.   

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Stephen, falsely accused by all, had shown us the aspects of angel. As a follower of Jesus and the light and salt of the world, do I reflect God's glory? 

+ **Fidelity** - Before being martyred, Stephen asked God to forgive those who falsely accused him. Would I pray for those who are against my faith? Can I forgive them?
