{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Solomon established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the Lord his God was with him and made him exceedingly great. 

+ Solomon asked God for wisdom and knowledge, that he may lead this numerous people. 

+ God gave Solomon wisdom and knowledge as well as wealth, possessions and honor. 

+ Solomon gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the Lord and a royal palace for himself. 

+ Solomon sent message to Hiram king of Tyre asking for cedar logs. Hiram sent man of skills and logs. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Solomon asked God for wisdom to enable him to serve. What am I asking for? Am I focusing on my own desires or God's kingdom? 

+ **Fidelity** - Solomon, the skilled workers, and labors worked together to construct the temple. Do I have the wisdom from God to co-work with others?
