### Question     
How did God continue with His plan through Jacob's sons?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jacob's sons sold their brother Joseph to Egypt foreshadows God's redemption plan. Genesis 38 is an important chapter of Jesus' genealogy. Tamar was one of the few women recorded in the lineage. Her faith humbled and ashamed Judah. 

+ God proceeded with His salvation plan through the jealousy of Jacob's sons as well as Tamar's faith. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Although Tamar followed the tradition to give her husband an offspring, but God was still pleased with her faith. Judah also admitted that Tamar was more righteous. How does Tamar's faith encourage me? 

+ **Integrity** - Joseph's brother sold him to Egypt driven by their jealousy. Such jealousy came from the dissatisfaction brought forth by comparison. How do I practice "Love is not Jealousy" and apply that to my life?
