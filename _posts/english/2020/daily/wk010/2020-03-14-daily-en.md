### Question     
Why did Jesus say He is the light of life?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery to test Jesus. Jesus said: "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." 

+ Jesus did not condemn her and told her to leave her life of sin. 

+ Jesus said: "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." 

+ Jesus said: "You will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come." 

+ To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said: "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." 

+ Jesus said: "If you were Abraham's children, then you would do what Abraham did." 

+ Jesus said: "If God were your Father, you would love me." 

+ Jesus said: "Very truly I tell you, before Abraham was born, I am!" 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus said, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing." It is the Father who glorifies Him. Do I work for my glory or God's glory? How does the Holy Spirit remind me of God's glory?
