### Question     
How may we worship God the Father?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus said to the Samaritan woman: "Will you give me a drink?" 

+ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life. 

+ Jesus pointed out the woman have had five husbands and the man she was with was not her husband. 

+ The true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. 

+ My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. 

+ Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 

+ Once more Jesus visited Cana in Galilee and there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. Jesus said to him: "Go, your son will live." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus said the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth. How may I worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth? Have I reflected on the Spirit and truth in my heart?
