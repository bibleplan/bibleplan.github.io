### Meditation: God's Story   
+ We must pay careful attention to God's word as it is crucial to our eternal lives. 

+ The salvation was first announced by the Lord, then confirmed by those who heard Him, then testified by signs, wonders, and various miracles, and by the gift of Holy Spirit distributed by His will. 

+ Do not ignore God's salvation. Willingly missing it will cause the utmost regret. 

+ Mankind was made a little lower than the angels, but still God gave mankind the authority over all creations. 

+ Jesus is our savior. He suffered death of flesh and blood so that we may be saved and freed from the slavery of our fear of death. 

+ Jesus' resurrection dissolved the power of sin and won over the authority of death.
