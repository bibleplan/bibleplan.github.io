### Question     
How to understand Jesus' duty as the great high priest
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord is the source of growth of our spiritual lives, we shall depend only on Him and make Him the goal of our focus. 

+ Jesus is the great high priest of grace and faith, the priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. 

+ Jesus can empathize with our weakness, has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet He did not sin. 

+ Jesus completely obeyed God's will to bear for us our suffering. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - How am I willing to accept and understand those who are weak in faith or have already fallen to encourage them to get closer to God? 

+ **Integrity** - Bible teaches us to move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity. Am I mature or still in the infant stage of my spiritual growth? How would I move forward in the knowledge of truth?
