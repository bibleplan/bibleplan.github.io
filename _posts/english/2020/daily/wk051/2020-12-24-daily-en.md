### Question     
What should our attitude toward God's discipline be?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God disciplines all His children. 

+ Our human fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. 

+ Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. 

+ Since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our "God is a consuming fire." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - God wants us to make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy. Am I able to live in peace with others so that God is glorified? 

+ **Integrity** - Have I ever been disciplined by God? What was my response to His discipline?
