### Question     
Where does faith come from?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. 

+ It is impossible to please God without faith because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. 

+ The universe was formed at God's command and His word shall make us fear Him. 

+ All these people of faith were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Do I keep faith in God when facing difficulties? What have I learned from these people of faith?
