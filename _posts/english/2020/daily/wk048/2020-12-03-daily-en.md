### Question     
What is the mystery for godliness?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The mystery for godliness is gospel. 

+ Some will abandon faith and impede people's understanding of truth by ways of superficial godliness. 

+ Stand firm on truth, train for godliness, have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales. 

+ Don't look down ourselves for young age, lack of maturity in Lord, or any other reasons. We shall always train for godliness and set examples for others. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - What is the mystery of godliness? What is a true godly life? What are the aspects of training for godliness? 

+ **Identity** - Paul encouraged Timothy not to be looked down for his young age. In other words, do not give up such that his own importance is not realized because others may not take him seriously for his age. What aspects of my life have I looked down upon and use them as excuses for not training myself to be godly? Is it age, maturity in the Lord, academic achievement, capability, or worldly success? I shall strive to train myself to be godly in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity, and be an example to other believers.
