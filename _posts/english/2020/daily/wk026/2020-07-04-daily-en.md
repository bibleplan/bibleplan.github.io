### Question     
How does a man redeem his vow to God?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Redeeming what is the Lord's is a very serious business. Man often take a vow to make wishes to the Lord during distress but then forget his vow afterward. Bible often warned against this type of behavior. This passage set a relatively high redeeming price with additional 20% for those who forget their vows. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God dislikes those who don't follow through with their vows. We must be prudent when signing a contract or making a promise. Have I made any promise to God, to my spouse, my friends, or my children? Do I always keep my promises? What should I do if I am in breach of my promises?
