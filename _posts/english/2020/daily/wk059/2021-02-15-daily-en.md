### Question     
How did Elisha succeed Elijah as prophet?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ahaziah king of Israel had fallen and injured himself. He sent messenger to consult the Ekron god Baal-Zebub instead of God. God sent Elijah to tell the messenger what God had told him about Ahaziah. 

+ When his time came, God took Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elisha refused to leave Elijah and filled by his spirit, Elisha succeeded Elijah as prophet. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Why did Ahaziah consulted Baal-Zebub instead of God? Have I gone after the rumor that something is effective but without inquiring God first? 

+ **Fidelity** - Elisha followed Elijah faithfully and asked for his spirit so that he may succeed him just like a son asking for inheritance. God fulfilled him. God gives works to His faithful servants. How does Elisha's faithfulness remind me? How may I pray to God persistently to serve Him by His calling?
