### Question     
How did Jehu clean off the families of the Israelite king and Judah king?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Prophet Elisha sent a man from the company of prophets to anoint Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. 

+ Jehu killed Joram king of Israel, Ahaziah king of Judah, and Jezebel. 

+ The officials of Jezreel obeyed Jehu's command and killed Ahab's seventy sons. 

+ Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab and the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah. 

+ Jehu destroyed Baal in Israel but did not turn away from the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. 

+ Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-eight years. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Ahab's son Joram and grandson Ahaziah were both killed. Were they innocent or guilty? (2 Kings 3:2-3,13-14; 8:25-27) How shall I look at the fairness of God's judgment? 

+ **Fidelity** - If God elected Jehu as His judge, why was Jehu later judged by God? Of my service to God, what are pleasing to Him and what are not?
