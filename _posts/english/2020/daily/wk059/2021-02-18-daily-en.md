### Question     
How did God help the Samarians to break out the siege?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Four men with Leprosy saw the Arameans had left their camp. They went back and reported the news. 

+ Ben-Hadad the Aramean king was ill. Hazel murdered Ben-Hadad and succeeded him as king. 

+ Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah. He reigned for eight years and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. 

+ Ahaziah son of Jehoram began his reign as king of Judah. He reigned for one year and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - How did the Lord help the Israelites to break out the siege? How has God helped me and protected me behind the scene? 

+ **Integrity** - The four men with leprosy (v. 9-10) realized what they did was not right and repented immediately. What can I learn from this?
