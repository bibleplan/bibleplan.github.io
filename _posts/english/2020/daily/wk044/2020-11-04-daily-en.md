### Question     
How should we view the freedom God gave us?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ To be devoid of fleshly indulgence, we must follow the Spirit, live by the Spirit, and bear the fruit of the Spirit. 

+ Follow the Spirit to do good to all people, carry each other's burdens, love others, and thus fulfill the law of Christ. 

+ Boast only in the cross of Christ and become a new creation. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - What is the relationship with others like when one lives by the Spirit? I shall always go back to my relationship with God first to find an answer when I have problems in my relationships. 

+ **Integrity** - How do the Spirit and flesh contradict each other? What real life example can I find on myself? What does this passage remind me of if the Spirit and my flesh are battling in me? Of the nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, which do I lack? Am I willing to rely on God to bear the fruit in me?
