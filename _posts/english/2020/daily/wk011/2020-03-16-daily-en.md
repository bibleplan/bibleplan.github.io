### Question     
What does it mean that Jesus said He is the gate for the sheep?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus used His saliva mixed with mud on the eyes of a blind and cured him. The day was a Sabbath. 

+ The Pharisees were divided on Jesus' curing of the blind on Sabbath. 

+ The blind believed Jesus as the Son of Man. 

+ Jesus said, I am the gate for the sheep, whoever enters through me will be saved. 

+ I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 

+ I and the Father are one. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Jesus says His is the good shepherd and would lay down His life for the sheep. Reflect on my love, how willing am I to lay myself down for others?
