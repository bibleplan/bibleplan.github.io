### Question     
What does the capturing of the ark of the covenant mean to the Israelites?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Israelites went to war with the Philistines. Israel was defeated but instead of inquiring the Lord, they bought out the ark of the covenant of the Lord as a tool. Israel was defeated again, and the ark was captured. The two sons of Eli were killed as predicted by the Lord and Eli died of falling. Eli's daughter-in-law died while giving birth and said: "the glory has departed from Israel." 

+ The Lord placed a heavy hand on the Philistines' idol Dagon and brought disaster to them. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Israelites were defeated by Philistines. They did not inquire of the Lord nor did they pray to seek His will. What were they thinking bring out the ark? How did Eli's honoring of his sons more than the Lord influence the Israelites? When I face difficulties, is my prayer an attempt to use the Lord as a tool according to my will? 

+ **Walking with God** - Israel's defeat does not mean God is powerless! What was displayed to the Philistines with the wonders done by the Lord in their land? Do I doubt God when my prayer isn't answered to my liking? What can I learn from what God did to the Philistines?
