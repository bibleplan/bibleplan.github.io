### Question     
Where did the universe come from?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Chapter 1 to chapter 2 verse 3 is the beginning of the Book of Genesis. It is prelude to the entire Bible. 

+ God create the world with His word. All was good and He created man and woman from His image; He rested on the 7th day and made that day Holy. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ Walk with God - How does understanding that all things in the world are created by God's word helps me to know the power of His word? Do I doubt the power of His word in transforming my own life? 

+ **Identity** - How does it help to know my own value and worth, knowing that God created me with His own image?
