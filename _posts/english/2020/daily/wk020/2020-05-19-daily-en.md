### Question     
What happened to Israel's descendants?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Death of Israel. Israel blessed all his sons. Joseph buried Israel in Canaan by his wish. The brothers were still afraid that Joseph would revenge. Joseph comforted them. Joseph died, and like his father, he asked his descendants to take him back to the promised land. 

+ Through Israel, God promised the Messiah would descend through Judah. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The story of Genesis ended but God's work has not. Through Israel's blessing, God promised the coming of Messiah from Judah's descendants. What do I see reflecting on the story of Genesis and connect the stories of God and of man? How does my story connect with God's? What encouragement and hope do I receive? 

+ **Community** - It can be depressing and feeling furious when wronged and persecuted by others. Joseph cried but did not revenge. Instead, he comforted his brothers. What can I learn from the grace and gentleness of Joseph to face the persecutions?
