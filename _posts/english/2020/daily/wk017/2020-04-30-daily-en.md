### Question     
How did God fulfill His promise to Abraham's descendants?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The story of promise continues. The birth of the son, Isaac, whom God had promised. 

+ Abraham was on the move again to the land of the Philistines and he lied again calling Sarah his sister. God kept Sarah, and she gave birth to Isaac the son of promise. Isaac grew, and Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away. Abimelek and Abraham in peace with each other. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Abraham, the father of faith, once again lied to the Gentiles that Sarah was his sister and put others in danger. Have I been overpowered by sin repeatedly? What lessons can I learn from Abraham's sin? 

+ **Fidelity** - Ishmael was not the chosen descendant of God, but God still watched over him. How does this remind me of how to treat people who don't know God?
