### Question     
What are the characteristics of a Christian's identity?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Rejoice in the Lord and pray often. 

+ I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. 

+ Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. 

+ My brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - How does it help me, knowing that I belong to the Kingdom of God and waiting for Christ's coming at any time? Where and how am I placing my hope, in the material world of today, or in the eternal transformation of my life? 

+ **Integrity** - We are not being complacent because of the promises we've already gotten from God. Paul said it clearly, forget what's behind but push hard toward what's ahead toward the goal to win the prize that God had already promised. How am I being encouraged by this so that I would push hard to live my life to glorify God?
