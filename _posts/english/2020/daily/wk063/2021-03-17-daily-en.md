### Question     
What preparations did David do for the construction of the temple?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ David provided a large amount of iron and more cedar logs than could be counted. 

+ David called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the Lord. 

+ David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Even though God did not allow David to build the temple for Him but David still made preparations for the person God had chosen. How do I view the duties God placed in my hands? What would I do if I need to be a stepping stone of others? 

+ **Fidelity** - Learning from the order David gave to all the leaders of Israel, what characters should I possess when leading others?
