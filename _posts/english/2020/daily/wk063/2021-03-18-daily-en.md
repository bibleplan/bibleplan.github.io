### Question     
What were the duties of the Levites?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. 

+ Levites twenty years old or more were counted individually and served in the temple of the Lord. 

+ The divisions of the descendants of Aaron. 
+ The rest of the descendants of Levi casted lots for their duties. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - In addition to preparing the material resources for constructing the temple, David also prepared human resources. In my service at church, how may I take care of both material and human resources? 

+ **Fidelity** - What were the different duties in the temple? What similarities do they compare to the duties in churches today?
