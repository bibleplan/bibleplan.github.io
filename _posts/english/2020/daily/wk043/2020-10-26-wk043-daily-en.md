### Question     
What is the life of an ambassador of Christ like?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ambassadors of Christ appeal for God to others to reconcile with God. 

+ Ambassadors of Christ commend themselves as servants of God in every way. 

+ Ambassadors of Christ speak freely and open widely their hearts to others. 

+ Be ambassadors of Christ, be sanctified, to purified, be fearing God, be reconciling with God, and be Holy. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Ambassadors of Christ commend themselves as servants of God in every way. Think about verses 6:3-10. How did Paul reveal himself as servant of God? How should I live out my life as God's servant? 

+ **Fidelity** - Ambassadors of Christ appeal to others to reconcile with God. What does it mean to appeal to others to reconcile with God? What does it remind me of those unbelievers whom I preach to and of those distressed fellow Christians whom I serve?
