### Question     
What are the instructions for priests?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God's instructions for priests. Including the priest's garment, the priest's duty, and the sacrifices. 

+ The purpose of priests is to be holy, to serve God, and to serve His people. In the Old Testament, God chose Aaron and his descendants to become priests. In the New Testament, God wants every believer to be His priest, to serve Him, to preach Him. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The identity of priest is glorious and magnificent. "You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9) How do I understand the meaning of this? How do I identify myself with this knowledge? 

+ **Fidelity** - The duty of a priest is to serve God and His people. We are told in 1 Peter 2:9 that we are of the Royal Priesthood. That we may declare the praises of him who called us out of darkness into his wonderful light. How should I proclaim God's truth?
