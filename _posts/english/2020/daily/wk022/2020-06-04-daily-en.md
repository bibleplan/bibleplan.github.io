### Question     
What did Moses go up to the Mount Sinai for?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Moses went up to Mount Sinai to receive the laws and commandments from God. God told Moses to accept offerings from people to build a sanctuary. This passage contains detailed instructions on materials and construction. 

+ God wanted to dwell among the Israelites in the sanctuary they build. God loves His people and wants to live with them. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God told Moses, "Tell the Israelites to bring me an offering. You are to receive the offering for me from everyone whose heart prompts them to give." God wants us to give willingly. Am I giving willingly? What's my attitude toward offering tithe to God? 

+ **Fidelity** - God reminded Moses, "Exactly like the pattern I will show you." It is important to keep obedience in mind when serving. Do I obey to God's will when I serve?
