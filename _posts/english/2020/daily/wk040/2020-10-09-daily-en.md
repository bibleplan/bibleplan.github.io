### Question     
What kind of life did Paul display in his parting words?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul would not dare to mention anything outside of what Lord Jesus Christ called him to do. 

+ Paul was determined to spread the gospel to the end of the earth. 

+ Paul asked all believers to work with him and pray for him. 

+ Paul advised all believers to greet each other, to watch out for those who serve their own appetite. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Paul explained the reasons for writing the letter and tasks he relegated to the Roman Christians in the closing words. From his writing, we can see fully that Paul's life is a testimony of the New Life in Christ. 
What can I learn from Paul in offering my own body as Living Sacrifice to serve God? What can I learn from Paul to stand for truth, hate evil, and cling to good? What can I learn from Paul to love others as myself?
