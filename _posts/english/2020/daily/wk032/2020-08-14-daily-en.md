### Question     
What did Moses say about the firstfruits and the third year? What about the thrice repeated phrase "this day?"
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After entering the promised land, the Israelites must offer the firstfruit, and proclaim God's redemption and blessings. 

+ The tenth of produce each third year must be put aside for the Levites, foreigners, widows, and the fatherless and proclaim that God's commands have not been forgotten. 

+ Moses repeated three times "this day" the Israelites have made a covenant with God, that God is their God and they are His people. They have become His treasured possession as He promised. 

+ Chapter 26 completes the declaration of the law and regulations started in chapter 12. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - All the goodness in my life are from God. I should be willing to give a tenth of what God gave me back to Him like Abel did. Ask God to help me remember all the blessings He has given to me over the years. Ask Him to help me to give tithe willingly.
