### Question     
How did David become king?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ All Israel came together to David at Hebron to anoint him as king. 

+ David captured the fortress of Zion. 

+ The records of the chiefs of David's mighty warriors-they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the Lord had promised. 

+ The fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - The mighty warriors were determined in unity to make David king, and they rejoiced together. How am I serving the Lord with my fellow Christians together in one heart? How am I rejoicing with them in the Lord? 

+ **Fidelity** - David's mighty warriors followed him because the Lord touched their hearts and they saw the David was with the Lord. Has my heart ever been touched by the Lord? How may we bring others to serve with us?
