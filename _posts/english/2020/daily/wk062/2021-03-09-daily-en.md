### Question     
What was the reason for Saul's death?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The record of Saul and his sons' death. 

+ Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord; he did not keep the word of the Lord and even consulted a medium for guidance, and did not inquire of the Lord. So the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Saul used to pursuit David and became the pursued. God is merciful and just. Man must bear the consequences of his sin if without Jesus' salvation. Let us thank God for His salvation so that we may receive eternal life. 

+ **Integrity** - The First Chronicles used the death of Saul as the starting point of a section in the book. What does that mean to me? Saul's unfaithfulness to the Lord was the cause of his downfall. How does that warn me?
