### Question     
Why was God angry to Solomon when he grew old?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Queen of Sheba witnessed the wisdom of Solomon. 

+ King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth. He also accumulated chariots and horses. 

+ King Solomon loved many foreign women. As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods. 

+ The Lord was angry with Solomon and raised up adversaries, Hadad the Edomite, Rezon son of Eliada, and Jeroboam son of Nebat against Solomon. 

+ Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh revealed to Jeroboam that Israel would be broken apart. 

+ Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - At the peak of Solomon's time, with much wealth and power, he chose to follow other gods and angered God. How could Solomon fall so far? What should I watch out for while my career and wealth are stacking up? 

+ **Fidelity** - What changed after Queen of Sheba visited Israel? What did Solomon do? Have I set a goal to glorify God every moment of my daily life?
