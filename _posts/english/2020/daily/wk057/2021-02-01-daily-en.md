### Question     
What did Solomon ask the Lord for?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter while the Israelites were still sacrificing at the high places. 

+ Solomon asked the Lord for a discerning heart. The Lord was pleased and gave Solomon the wisdom to govern. 

+ God gave Solomon a wise and discerning heart, faithful officials and governors, gave prosperity for all people, and peace on all sides. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Why was God pleased with what Solomon asked for? What do I ask for in my prayers? Make a connection to what Jesus taught us in His Sermon on the Mount. What does it remind me of? 

+ **Identity** - God's promise to Abraham of kingdom, people, and blessings is now becoming a reality under Solomon's reign. What promise from God have become a reality in my life?
