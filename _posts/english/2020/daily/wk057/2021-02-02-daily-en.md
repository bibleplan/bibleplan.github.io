### Question     
How did Solomon start in building the temple?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Solomon made a treaty with Hiram king of Tyre to build the temple. They transported lumbers on the sea from Lebanon to Israel. 

+ Four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, he began to build the temple of the Lord. 

+ Israelites worked together to build the temple. The inner rooms, cherubim, and outer rooms all followed the Lord's command. Seven years spanned in building the temple. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What was the first building being constructed in the fourth year of Solomon's reign? Why did he start from this building first? What am I building up? What is the most important construction of my life? 

+ **Fidelity** - Israelites worked with foreigners to build the temple. How do I see my own service? How do I see those co-workers of mine who are yet to believe in the Lord? How may I approach them?
