### Question     
Why is Jesus' death and resurrection so significant?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul reiterated the gospel to correct the false view of those who did not believe Jesus' resurrection. 

+ The resurrection of Jesus demonstrates God's power. 

+ Paul persecuted the church then became the smallest of the apostles. Through God's grace, he became an important vessel of God's purpose.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - How do I see death? Do I believe in resurrection? Why? 

+ **Fidelity** - Paul reminded us to stand firm, let nothing move us. Always give us fully to the work of the Lord, because we know that our labor in the Lord is not in vain. Am I serving the Lord with such a strong mind and faith?
