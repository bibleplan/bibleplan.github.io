### Question     
How was the inheritance divided up for the rest of the tribes?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The inheritance was divided up in different way than the tribes of Judah and Joseph. 
+ The Tribe of Benjamin was first to receive their inheritance which included the yet to be conquered Jerusalem. Then the remaining tribes. 
+ The last was allotted to Joshua. The narrative on dividing the inheritance of land started and ended with the two Israelites of previous generation: Caleb and Joshua.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - As the leader of Israel, Joshua waited till the last to receive his inheritance. What can I learn from Joshua's humbleness to put the benefits of others first?
