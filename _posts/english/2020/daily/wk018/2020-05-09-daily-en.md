### Question     
What became of Jacob and his family?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The character of Jacob's sons and death of Jacob. 

+ Jacob's daughter Dinah was defiled by Shechem when she went visit the women of the land. Her brothers deceived and killed all Shechem's men while they were still in pain, looted their city, took their women and children. This horrific act put Jacob's family in great danger. Jacob listened to God to purify his entire family and moved back to Bethel.  

+ God wants to set apart His people from the world. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Dinah put herself in danger. Her brothers caused much suffering through their fleshly rage and revenge. Jacob saw his inadequacy in leading his family. He therefore followed God's will and purified his entire family to serve only the one true God. How does this story remind me of my own responsibilities in raising my family?
