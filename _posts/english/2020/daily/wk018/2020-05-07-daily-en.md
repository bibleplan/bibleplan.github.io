### Question     
How did Jacob's descendants increase as God promised?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The story of Jacob's 12 sons, the ancestor of the Israel's 12 tribes. 

+ Jacob started off from where He met God and went to stay with his uncle Laban. Laban tricked Jacob to marry Leah. God blessed Jacob with increased wealth and offspring. 

+ Even with trickery, people cannot change God's promise. God always faithfully lead those who lean on Him, however sinful they might be, onto the righteous path. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Leah was not as pretty as her sister and wasn't loved as much by her husband. But God blessed Leah and she moved her focus from her husband to God. What does this remind me of? Where's my value and what is my worth? 

+ Walk with God - Jacob learned a lot about God and grew in faith during the 12 years he worked for Laban. Have I ever been treated unfairly in my own job and life? How did God lead me to know Him deeper? How did my relationship with God grow in prayer?
