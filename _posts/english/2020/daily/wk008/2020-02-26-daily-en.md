### Question     
What is God's intention for us and how should we respond to Him?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Be humble and take seat at the lowest place in a wedding feast. 

+ Many refused to attend the Banquet in the Kingdom of God. 

+ The cost of discipleship. 

+ God searches for the lost souls. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God loves us and asks us to feast with Him. Do I understand that I am sitting with Him today? How does it affect my conduct knowing this fact? 

+ **Fidelity** - God searches for all those who are lost. Can I comprehend how God loves the world? Can I love all those around me as God loves the world? Am I praying desperately for their salvation? Am I willing to pass the Good News onto them?
