### Question     
What is true faith? 
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus spoke of the true meaning of Sabbath. 

+ Parable for the Kingdom of God. One must strive to enter through the narrow gate to follow Jesus. 

+ Jesus' sorrow for Jerusalem. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The path of Jesus is not easy. He teaches us to make every effort to enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. Do I brush aside God's salvation? Is my conduct commensurate to Jesus' grace? 

+ **Fidelity** - It is by God's grace and mercy that Jesus healed the sick during Sabbath. Do I value precious souls higher than rules and regulations?
