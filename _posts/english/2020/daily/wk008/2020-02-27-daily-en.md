### Question     
How may one have faith in God's Kingdom?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus teaches us that if we are faithful in the insignificant, we will then be faithful in the important. 

+ Different endings for the rich man who enjoyed earthly wealth and the poor beggar Lazarus. 

+ Faith as small as mustard seed. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus teaches that we cannot serve both God and money. Who am I serving? Is my heart set on the Kingdom of God or the corruptible temporal pleasures of the world? 

+ **Fidelity** - Do I seek other people's approvals or the fulfillment in presence of God when I serve? Am I pursuing a sense of self-satisfaction and feeling of success? Or, do I want to know God deeper?
