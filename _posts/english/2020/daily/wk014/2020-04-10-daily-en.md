### Question     
What dangers did Paul face in Jerusalem?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul went on to Jerusalem despite dangers. 

+ Paul stated his repentance and portrayed God's calling. 

+ Paul escaped death for his Roman citizenship. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - When facing the crowd and his life was threatened, Paul calmly spoke to the crowd for he believed in God that he would be used for His purpose. Let us lean on God and ask Him to transform our lives so that we can have a genuine relationship with God like Paul. 

+ **Fidelity** - Persecution gave Paul the chance to testify for the gospel to the crowd. In time of distress, would I see God's plan and find it as opportunity to testify for the gospel?
