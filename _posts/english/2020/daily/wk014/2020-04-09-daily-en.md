### Question     
How did Paul bid farewell to the elders of the Ephesian church?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God's way transforms people's heart. The business of idol making fell like a rock. 

+ I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Paul not only preached but lived out a transformed life that endured trials and tribulations. Am I asking God for blessings only but not willing to surrender myself for the gospel?
