### Question     
What did God do when Pharaoh's heart continued to harden?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Pharaoh never completely obeyed God and continued to bargain in "partial submission" even after so many plagues. God is all knowing and omnipotent. There is no bargaining with God because His will is always accomplished. 

+ God commanded Moses to tell his descendants everything happened in Egypt. God works wonders and we ought to proclaim in His name. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Moses transformed from a cowardly and undecisive person to a faithful servant of God who was able to stand up against the Pharaoh on all things. What kind of transformations can I see from a person who walks with God? What can I learn from Moses? 

+ **Integrity** - Gone through plagues after plagues, Pharaoh continued to rebel against God because of his pride. Do I truly know God's greatness? Am I willing to submit to Him completely?
