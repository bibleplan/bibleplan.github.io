### Question     
What was the first thing the Israelites prepared for before going into Canaan?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Joshua sent spies to Jericho. God saved the spies through the lowly prostitute named Rahab. 

+ The spies brought back the news that Jericho was filled with fear. Compare this to scouts' report in Numbers 13-14 and how it affected the Israelites. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Rahab was a Gentile yet God used her to save His people. I was once among the Gentiles but God chose me. Compare my life before and after knowing God. How has it transformed through my new identity? Pray and ask God to continue transform me. 

+ **Integrity** - I was a Gentile, I am imperfect, and I am still rebellious and full of sins. Reflect on my past identity and give thanks to the Lord. Atone to God and ask Him to remove my ugly mask. Ask the Lord to give me a spiritual buddy, to pray with me, to lift each other up, to grow and sanctify together. 

+ **Fidelity** - It can be seen from Rahab's story that God is not biased against the Gentiles who believe and have faith in Him. Are there Gentiles around me? Can I treat them with grace and love them like God treated Rahab?
