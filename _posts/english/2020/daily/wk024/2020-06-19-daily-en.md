### Question     
What is the offering for offenses against God or another man?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The last of the five offerings. 

+ 5:14-19 is for offenses against Holy Objects whether knowingly or unknowingly. 6:1-7 is for offenses against other people, fraud, stealing, robbery, and oppressive actions. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - No matter if it's something we are born with or acquired in life, we need God to forgive and cleanse. Jesus Christ made the ultimate offering for us so that we may be seen as righteous by God. We are, however, weak and continue to sin. God established High Priest in time of Old Testament to help the Israelites. What has our Highest Priest, Jesus Christ, done for me so that I may be cleansed and purified from my sins? 

+ **Identity** - During the time of Old Testament, the Israelites brought Sin Offerings so that "they will be forgiven for any of the things they did that made them guilty." Am I struggling with sin and unable to face God? How does this promise help and encourage me?
