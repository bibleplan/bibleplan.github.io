### Question     
What happened after the completion of the Tabernacle?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Upon Tabernacle's completion, God told Moses to set it up and He filled the Tabernacle. 

+ The phrase "as the Lord commanded" appeared eight times again in this chapter. Everything had to be done according to His commands. 

+ God designed the salvation plan. The stories in Exodus gives us a preview of His plan. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The climax of building the Tabernacle was God fulfilling the Tabernacle. God's fulfilling of the Tabernacle signifies His presence, leading, and protection. As a believer and receiver of Holy Spirit, do I often experience His presence, leading, and protection? 

+ **Fidelity** - "And so Moses finished the work" (verse 33). Fidelity in serving includes "as the Lord commanded" as well as "finishing the work". Do I follow through all the way and see to the completion when I serve?
