### Question     
How did the conflict between Jesus and the Pharisees escalate?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ By God's power, Jesus drove out the daemon. 

+ Blessed are those who hear God's word and obey it. 

+ Jesus gave the sign of Jonah to that generation. 

+ The hypocrisy of the Pharisees is not pleasing to God.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - God displays His power through our services. So, we don't serve God to show off our own abilities, nor do we dread for our insufficiency. Am I relying on myself or God to enable me to serve? 

+ **Integrity** - Jesus criticized the hypocritical Pharisees that they put emphasis on superficial cleanliness but glossed over in cleansing their hearts. Do I seek a fabricated self-image and praises from others or do I desire a purified heart and Godly life?
