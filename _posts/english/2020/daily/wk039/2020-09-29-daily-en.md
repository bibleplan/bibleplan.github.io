### Question     
Why can't we claim righteousness for our work?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Righteousness comes not from works. 

+ Righteousness comes not from religious ceremonies and formalities. 

+ Righteousness comes not from obeying the laws. 

+ Righteousness comes by faith alone so that we can reconcile with God and be saved by God. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - What does it mean to reconcile with God? How have I gone against God before I became a believer? How have I reconciled with Him afterward? 

+ **Community** - Righteousness does not come from our works, nor from obeying the laws, nor from religious ceremonies, but from faith and from faith alone. The Jews emphasized on their works, their ceremonies, their relentless pursuing of the law to the letters, and looked down on the gentiles. Have I fallen into the same trap and look down on those who are yet to believe the Lord?
