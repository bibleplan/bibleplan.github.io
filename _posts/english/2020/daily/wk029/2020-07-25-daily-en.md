### Question     
What should the Israelites' life be like when they arrive at the promised land?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In Numbers chapter 32, the Gadites, Reubenites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had their eyes on the land to the east of Jordan river. They promised Moses that they would help the rest of the Israelites enter the promised land first. They saw the land was fertile and suitable for grazing, wanted to settle down quickly. Later, due to the lack of natural barriers, they were the first to be captured and occupied by the Assyrian before the entire nation of Israel fell. 

+ Faithfully following God's command, Moses documented the 40 encampment sites during the 40 years of wandering in Numbers chapter 33. 

+ God commanded Israelites to drive out the idol worshiping people to end idolatry from the promised land. He also commanded the tribes to distribute the land by lot according to their sizes. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Gadites, Reubenites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh choose the land by the value seen in their own eyes. But they never expected the disaster to follow. Are there things in my life that are valuable to the eyes of the world but not pleasing to God? 

+ **Integrity** - When victory was in sight, God commanded the Israelites not to relax allowing idolatry to corrupt their hearts once they enter the promised land. Entering the promised land does not make an end to the journey of faith. While I enjoy many freedoms and privileges in my faith today, how can I remind myself to stay vigilant?
