### Question     
What is the real reason behind Saul's fear for David?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ David met Jonathan and through him reaffirmed Saul's attempt to kill David. 

+ Jonathan and David made a covenant to bring their families together through their friendship. 

+ David began his life as an exile. For his own safety, David lied to the priest and cause the death of the entire town of priests. He pretended to be insane in front of the Philistines and got kicked out. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The friendship between Jonathan and David faced great challenge. David accused Jonathan of knowing Saul's will. How did Jonathan answer David's accusation? Being a prince, how was Jonathan's integrity reflected in his reaction to David? It can be seen that Jonathan knew God's will from the covenant between him and David. What choice did Jonathan make? 

+ **Integrity** - David had little help and was surrounded by enemies in the early days of his exile. David was not without weakness. Why did David lie to the priest and pretend to be insane in front of the Philistines? Read Psalms 34 and 55 to get a taste of what David experienced when he was weak and how leaned on God.
