### Question     
What were God's instructions in building the Tabernacle?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God instructed the Israelites to start building the Tabernacle. 

+ God instructed the Israelites to first observe the Sabbath, to give willingly, and God would give the craftsmen the wisdom, knowledge, and skills. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - It was expensive to build the Tabernacle and yet, the Israelites had surplus from their offerings. God always provides. How should I view my services, my offerings, and my faith in God? 

+ **Fidelity** - Building the Tabernacle required money, material, time, skills, and energy from everyone. They contributed willingly. Am I willingly contributing what I have to serve God?
