### Question

Who was the most virtuous among all the kings of Judah?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story

- Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years.
- Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah.
- Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
- Sennacherib sent Rabshakeh to speak brazenly to the people of Judah.

### Meditation: My Story

- **Integrity** - Hezekiah was the most virtuous among all the kings of Judah and the Lord made him successful in whatever he undertook. So, why did Assyria capture the fortified cities of Judah? How do I view my life's suffering?
- **Integrity** - How does the brazen talk of Rabshakeh sound familiar to me? Are there unbelievers despise Christians today? How should we face their comments?
