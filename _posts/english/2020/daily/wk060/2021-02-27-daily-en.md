### Question

How Judah started to decline after Hezekiah?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story

- Manasseh reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
- Through His servants and prophets, the Lord proclaimed He would bring disaster on Jerusalem and Judah for the detestable sins Manasseh had committed.
- Amon reigned in Jerusalem two years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
- Amon was killed and Josiah his son succeeded him as king.

### Meditation: My Story

- **Integrity** - After Hezekiah, Manasseh rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. How do I view the influences of family and sin?
- **Fidelity** - With Judah's decline yet again, we can see how easily people stray away from God and how a king can bring down a nation. How am I influencing others? Is it for good or bad?
