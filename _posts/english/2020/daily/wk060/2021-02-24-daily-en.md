### Question

How was Israel subjugated?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story

- Hoshea became king of Israel. King of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria.
- The Israelites worshiped other gods and did wicked things that aroused the Lord's anger. So, the people of Israel were taken from their homeland into exile in Assyria.
- The king of Assyria brought people from other nations and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. One of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the Lord.
- Even while these people were worshiping the Lord, they were serving their idols. To this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their ancestors did.

### Meditation: My Story

- **Identity** - What was the main reason that Israel was subjugated? How may I pray for the country I live in?
- **Identity** - The Israelites mixed up their faith with the gentile's. How am I being influenced like them?
