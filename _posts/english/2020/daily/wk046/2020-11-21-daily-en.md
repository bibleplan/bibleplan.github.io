### Question     
Who is Paul's hope or joy or crown of happiness?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul's hope, joy, and crown of happiness is the believers when they stand before Lord Jesus Christ when He comes again. 

+ The reason Paul wanted very much to be with them and sent ahead Timothy was to strengthen and help complete the Thessalonian believers' faith. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Paul worried that His suffering would cause the Thessalonian believers to give up their faith. God uses suffering to strengthen the believers' faith, but it can also be used by Satan as distraction. The suffering Paul remembered the believers. At the same time, the believers' faith was strengthened to bring comfort to Paul. To face suffering has always been difficult but through Paul's suffering, we see God blessed, comforted, and strengthened Paul and Thessalonian believers. How does today's passage help me view the sufferings myself or others are facing? 

+ **Community** - God gave us shepherds who look after us. Likewise, there may be others who need our shepherding. How does Paul's love to the believers remind me to love those around me? How does believers' response to Paul remind me how I shall respond to my shepherds?
