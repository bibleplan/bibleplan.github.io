### Question     
How were the census conducted and tribes' camps arranged?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The first census and where each of the tribes were placed around the Tent of Meeting. 

+ The census was for "twenty years old or more and able to serve in the army." (1:3) The tribes were arranged according to their army divisions. God turned the Israelites from a group of slaves into an army. He prepared them for war to fight their way into the promised land. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The Israeli tribes were arranged around the Tabernacle to put God in the center. Am I placing God in the center of my life? 

+ **Identity** - God promised Abraham to become a great nation when he had no hope of having offspring. By this time, those who were 20 or older numbered at 603,550, not counting the tribe of Levi. The promise was being fulfilled one step at a time. Is the value of everything I see based on God's promise? 

+ **Fidelity** - He transformed the Israelites from slaves to army. Do I know that I was a slave of sin and now, with God's salvation, an elite solder of His army?
