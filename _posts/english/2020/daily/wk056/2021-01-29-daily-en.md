### Question     
What sin did David commit in his old age?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ David ordered Joab to take a census of Israel and Judah. 

+ David knew he committed great sin and was conscience-stricken after the census was completed. 

+ David picked plague out of the choice of three disasters. Seventy thousand from Dan to Beersheba died. 

+ David built an altar for God, sacrificed burnt offering and fellowship offering. The plague on Israel stopped. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What did David pick out of the three disasters God let him choose from? Why? How do I view God's discipline? 

+ **Integrity** - Why did David take census? What similar mistakes have I done in my life? What does this remind me of?
