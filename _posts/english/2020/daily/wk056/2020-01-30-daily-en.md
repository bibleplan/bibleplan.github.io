### Question     
How did Solomon succeed David to become king for he was not David's first born?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ David was very old. Adonijah conspired with Joab and Abiathar in attempt to usurp the throne. 

+ Nathan the prophet and Solomon's mother Bathsheba went to David to uncover the conspiracy. 

+ David took an oath by the Lord to make Solomon king and anointed him in Gihon. David gave a charge to Solomon then died. 

+ Solomon made Shimei to promise to stay in Jerusalem. Shimei broke the promise and was struck down. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Adonijah attempted to usurp the throne and David had never rebuked him. David did not fulfill his responsibility as a father. He did not discipline his children and got to taste the consequences. For us who are parents, what can we learn from David's example? 

+ **Fidelity** - Right after learning Adonijah's plan, David acted wisely and fulfilled his promise to have Solomon succeed him to the throne. David was decisive under God's witness. Likewise, we may be decisive without any doubt if we act in His Name.
