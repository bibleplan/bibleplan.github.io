### Meditation: God's Story   
+ 2 Samuel 22 is David's thanksgiving to the Lord for delivering him from Saul and all his enemies. The same song is also recorded in Psalm 18. In the first part, David depicted how God saved him when he faced death from his enemy (22:5-20). In the second part, David described how God's salvation is based on faith (22:21-30). In the third part, David counted the helps God had given to him (22:31-46) 

+ 2 Samuel 23:1-7 is David's praising and thanksgiving to God near the end of his life. He realized it was the spirit of God working in him and looked up to God's everlasting covenant with him and his descendants. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Although David had committed many sins in his life, but God still proclaims that David was pleasing to Him. What can I see in David's heart from his psalms? How did he see God in saving him? How did he see God's response to those who follow Him? Near the end of his life, how did David see God's promise in his own life? What is a heart that is pleasing to God?
