### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God established marriage to keep us faithful to our spouses. 

+ We may faithfully serve God whether married or not. 

+ Circumcise or not is nothing. Keeping God's command is what counts. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What is God's calling for me in marriage? How do I follow God's will to have a holy married life? 

+ **Fidelity** - For whether I'm married or not, how do I use my situation to serve the Lord?
