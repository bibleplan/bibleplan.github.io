### Question     
How to win over temptations?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Israelites failure in front of temptation shall serve as a warning to us. 

+ God is faithful that He always provides a way out of temptation. 

+ Not to seek our own good but for the good of many others. 

+ Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Do I have any idol in my life? Do I put it higher than God? How can I get rid of the idol? 

+ **Community** - How should I build up my fellow Christians through my freedom in Christ?
