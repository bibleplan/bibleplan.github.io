<h3>Forward</h3>

We are moving to the study of the Book of Deuteronomy this week.

`Deuteronomy` may seem like an outdated book to many Christians today. We are living in the age of grace, the age of law is way past us. Jesus loved to quote `Deuteronomy`. If we don't understand the Pentateuch, understand thoroughly the word that gives life, then we cannot see the salvation plan in its entirety. Deuteronomy is Moses' remembrance of God. It's a display of God's work where He placed grace upon a people that did not deserve grace. It is where He patiently saved them from sin and gave them the mission of blessing. It's a reflection of God's plan for mankind.

Moses challenged the Israelites to respond to God by pointing out the covenant between God and man, by asking for forgiveness for man's rebellion and unfaithfulness, so that they would see all God's characters. It was Moses' life long mission in watching over the herd God gave him and the blessings to them before his passing. He was paving the road in the wilderness for the Lord and to proclaim God's word for millenniums.

May our Lord renew you all daily in His word!
