### Forward     
We are finishing the reading on the Book of Deuteronomy and starting on the Book of Joshua.

Moses' parting words to the Israelites in the Book of Deuteronomy emphasized the importance of listening to God's word. God called us to worship Him is to reveal His word to us. We hear God's voice when we read Bible or listen to sermons so that we can follow His commands.

God's word is often absent from our daily lives even though Moses kept emphasizing its importance. We don't even open the Bible. We ignore the practicality and the life in God's word. Let us stop substituting God's word with worldly lies which are filled with temptations and foolishness. Let us read His word, hear His voice, and meet Him in our worship. God's command is so wide and deep that its vastness dwarfs the universe. His word never changes, is eternal. 

May the Lord's word renew you all every day.
