### Forward

Dear Brothers and Sisters:

In this week’s reading, we will learn about the potential conflicts when we co-work with other fellow Christians as well as God’s protection to His servants and His will toward them. In addition, we will read about the important events in the last year when Israelites wandered in the desert:
+ Passing of Moses’ sister Miriam and brother Aaron indicating the beginning of the transition to the next generation.

+ Edom, the descendant of Esau, blocking Israelites’ passage marks the start of the hostile history between Edom and Israel.

+ Victory over the kings of Canaan and Amorite marks the start of the battle to advance into the land of Canaan.

+ The interactions of Israelites with Balaam and Moab, marking the begging of the influences of idolatry and paganism in Israel’s history.
May our Lord bless and renew all brothers and sisters with His word every day!
