### Forward
We continue reading the Book of Deuteronomy this week.

Deuteronomy is an important and applicable book for today’s believers. Moses’ exhortation and warning in Deuteronomy proved that human nature is the never ending idol factory. Although it speaks of the treachery of Israelite, but the same idol is worshiped by all mankind.

We will not see nor hear God if we forget the revelation and the grace in His salvation and covenant. We will turn a blind eye to God and act as if there were no God. Although we might not carve out idol out of a piece of wood, we continue to find other things to worship. Idols are anything that replaces God, whether animate or inanimate, concrete or abstract. Idols are not necessarily evil. Even God created the sun, moon, and stars. But they are to serve as witnesses to God’s glory, not for us to worship and rely on as the source of our ultimate happiness. Any good thing can become an idol and replaces God if we make it indispensable in our life. Insatiable desires will ruin the peace and joy from God and will trample on the glory and honor of God. Anyone with intelligence shall watch out and not be seduced by the created and worship them.

May our Lord’s word renew you all each day!
