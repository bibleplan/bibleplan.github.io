### Forward       
We continue reading the Book of Joshua this week.

This book is a continuation of the Pentateuch of Moses. It is the promise God made to Israelites' ancestor, a record of realization of man co-working with God. How did the Israelites lead by Joshua rely on God when faced with the unknown enemy in Canaan? Fear is an emotional response when facing danger and it intensifies in unstable environment. The fear of failure clouded the Israelites when the battle was about to begin. They feared their lack of ability to conquer the land, they feared their lack of ability to withstand the tests.

The power of darkness does exist in the real world, but panic is not a beneficial emotion. The reassurance God gave Joshua continue to provide the following four encouragements to those who face challenges today: First, knowledge of our identity and value brings us the missional life in Christ Jesus; Second, the word of God guides us so we wont get lost; Then, God gives us the spiritual community, church, to unite all Christians as one; Above all, God is with us so that we are strong and courageous no matter where we go.

May our Lord's word renew you all each day!
