<h3>Forward</h3>
We are now completing the reading on the `Book of Leviticus` and starting on the `Book of Numbers`.

Tips and highlights of this week’s reading:
* `Leviticus` records the law God gave to Israelites on the Mount Saini to help them to be holy, to be
gracious, and to live out a righteous life in loving relationship with God and other people. 

* Understanding God’s holiness is required to be holy. God’s holiness was revealed in their history how
God lead the Israelites as a relationship. So, the result of our holiness should not be expressed only as
our actions, but the outcome of our hearts. As apostle Paul said: "
>May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you. May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
" `1 Thessalonians 3:12-13`

* The `Book of Numbers` is the account of God’s work in rebuilding the Israelites. After leaving Mount Saini,
the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for 40 years and finally entered the promised land in the plains
of Moab.

May you all be renewed in God’s word!
