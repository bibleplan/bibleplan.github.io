<h3>Forward</h3>

We are about to walk out of the desert! This week we’ll complete the reading on the Book of Numbers and continue into the `Book of Deuteronomy`. The reading gives the account of the preparations and commands God gave Israelites before they went into the promised land.
+ The second census and promise reiterated: the second generation from the desert was about to enter the promised land.
+ Various questions on inheritances reflected the fact that the Israelites would make home on the promised land for the long run.
+ Worship centered life of the future Israelites is reflected on the regular offerings.
+ Land and people must be kept holy.

May our Lord bless and renew you all with His word every day!
