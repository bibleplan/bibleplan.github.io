Book of Joshua, the account of Israelites entering the land of Canaan to take possession the Promised Land.
### Question     
How did God lead the Israelites after Moses' passing?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God called upon Joshua to succeed Moses and commanded him to lead Israelites to go into the land promised to their ancestors. 

+ God continued to be the main character in the Book of Joshua. 

+ See how important God viewed faith and covenant from the calling of Joshua. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - God told Joshua repeatedly "be strong and courageous" because He will be with them. Am I staying put because I rely on myself or am I strong and courageous because I have faith in God? 

+ **Fidelity** - Compare the scene where God called upon Joshua to lead the Israelites to the scene where Jesus commissioned disciples in Matthew 28. Think about my life and faith. Am I staying on the east side of Jordan River where life is easy and safe or am I stepping out of my comfort zone to take up the great commission?
