### Question     
How would the Lord put the nations on trial?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There He will put them on trial. 
+ In that day, all the ravines of Judah will run with water. A fountain will flow out of the Lord's house and will water the valley of acacias. 
+ Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste. 
+ Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem, the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the Lord will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel. How am I experiencing God as my refuge and my stronghold?
