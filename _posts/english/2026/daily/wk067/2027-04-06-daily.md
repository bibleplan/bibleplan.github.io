### Question     
How did God lead Israel with the cord of human kindness and ties of love?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ When Israel was a child, God loved him, and called him out of Egypt. 
+ But the more they were called, the more they went away from God. They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images. 
+ A sword will flash in their cities; it will devour their false prophets and put an end to their plans. 
+ They will follow the Lord; He will roar like a lion. When he roars, His children will come trembling from the west. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms, led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them He was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek and bent down to feed them. How does this help me to see and understand God's love?
