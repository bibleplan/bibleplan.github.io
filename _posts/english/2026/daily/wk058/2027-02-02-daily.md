### Question     
What would become of the Philistines and Moabites?
  
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jeremiah prophesied the day had come for the Lord to destroy all the Philistines and to remove all survivors who could help Tyre and Sidon. 

+ Jeremiah prophesied the punishment to Moab, the woe to Nebo, the disgrace and capture of Kiriathaim and the shattering of Misgab. 

+ Moab would be ashamed of Chemosh, as Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel. 

+ Moab had defied the Lord and ridiculed Israel, for her arrogance, her insolence, her pride, her conceit, and the haughtiness of her heart. 

+ The fortunes of Moab would be restored. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The destruction of the Philistines came from the Lord. Who is in control of the rise and fall of the nations today? How do I look at the politics of the world? How does my view affect me?
