### Question     
What did Jesus debate with the priests, teachers of the law and elders in the temple?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the temple, Jesus taught about His authority and Israel's rebellion, paying tax, marriage at resurrection. 

+ The commandment on "love God, love others" and hypocrisy of the teachers of the law. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - We are citizens of some country and, more importantly, we are people of the Heavenly Kingdom. From the question on paying tax to Caesar, how do I understand my double identity? Do I often remember my identity in the Heavenly Kingdom? 

+ **Fidelity** - The commandment "love God, love others" contrasts greatly with the hypocrisy of the teachers of the law. Let me reflect on my service to the Lord. Is it based on my love of God and others or is it based on my desire for self-glorification?
