### Question     
What was Jesus' teaching about the End of Times?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The poor widow's offering reveals how God sees offerings. 

+ Jesus taught the signs of the End of Times and the need to be alert. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The widow was poor but offered willingly. How do I view money? Do I offer willingly or with reservations? 

+ **Integrity** - No one knows when Jesus will come again. Am I always being alert and will answer to the Lord honestly or do I live a life in deceit and hope that I'll not get caught?
