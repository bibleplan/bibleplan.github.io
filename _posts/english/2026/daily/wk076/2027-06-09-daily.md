### Question     
What were the events through Jesus' betrayal and arrest? 
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ An alabaster jar of expensive perfume made of nard was poured over Jesus' head to prepare for His death. 

+ Passover supper and Gethsemane prayer. 

+ Jesus' arrest and trial as well as being disowned by Peter three times. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The woman who poured the expensive perfume over Jesus' head knew His identity and treasured Him. Do I also treasure Jesus and willingly offer my all? 

+ **Integrity** - Peter was full of confidence that he would never disown Jesus and yet did it three times. Do I rely all my actions on my own confidence or on faith in God? Let me pray and ask the Holy Spirit to remind me of my fleshly weakness and help me to win over it.
