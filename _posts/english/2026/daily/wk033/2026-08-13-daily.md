### Question

How did God save Hezekiah?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story

- Hezekiah sent the palace administrator and the secretary to the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah foretold the Lord's deliverance.
- The angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp.
- The Lord healed Hezekiah's illness and added fifteen years to his life.
- Hezekiah let Babylonian king's envoys to see all the treasures in his storehouses.
- Isaiah prophesized that the entire Judah would be taken to Babylon.

### Meditation: My Story

- **Identity** - What was the main point of Hezekiah's prayer? What can I learn from this prayer?
- **Integrity** - Why would Hezekiah's showing the treasures to Babylonian envoys bring about Isaiah's prophesy? How should I treat my blessings from God?
