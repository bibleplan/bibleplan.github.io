### Question     
What happened before the seventh seal was opened?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Another angel has the seal of the living God. 

+ The number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel. 

+ A great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice: "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb." 

+ These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 

+ When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 

+ Seven angels stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 

+ Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. What comforting do I need and where am I seeking it? Why don't I seek comfort in Jesus Christ?
