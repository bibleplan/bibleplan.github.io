### Question     
Who could change the fate of the Jews?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Mordecai tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, wailing loudly and bitterly. 

+ Mordecai instructed Esther to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people. 

+ Esther asked all the Jews: "To fast for three days. When this is done, I would go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish." 

+ When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. 

+ Haman set up a pole in preparation to kill Mordecai. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Mordecai asked Esther to risk her life to help him. Why didn't he ask God to help? How does God prepare us for the struggles we face today with questions like this?
