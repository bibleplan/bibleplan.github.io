### Question     
Who were the descendants of the tribes to the west of Jordan river?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The sons of Issachar. 

+ The descendants of Benjamin. 

+ Sons of Naphtali.  

+ The descendants of Manasseh. 

+ The descendants of Ephraim. 

+ Asher's sons.   

+ The detailed genealogy of Benjamite. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The accounts of the tribes recorded in chapter 7 were relatively simple. Is my life's journey with or without God? Is it filled with the story of God or is there not much to talk about?
