### Question     
How did Paul continue to proclaim gospel after he had arrived in Rome?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Roman Jews were willing to hear the gospel knowing the Christian faith was slandered everywhere. 

+ Salvation went to the Gentiles as some Jews believed while some were blinded and did not believe.  

+ Paul proclaimed the Kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Long time believers may become laxed, slackened, and satisfied for merely being saved. In drilling down to the root cause, we might find blinded hearts. Have I laxed on my way to sanctification? Has the world deceived me from God's truth?  

+ **Fidelity** - Paul did not give up on those who were blinded. Rather, he welcomed all who came to see him and proclaimed the Kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ. Have I ever given up testifying for God because few ever believed me?
