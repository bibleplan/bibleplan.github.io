### Question     
What were the differences between the value of the Kingdom of Heaven and the value of the world that Jesus spoke to His disciples?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus spoke of the value of the Kingdom of Heaven. Be weary of the Pharisees' yeast. Do not be afraid of the world but fear God. 

+ Do not gather earthly riches but heavenly treasure in God. 

+ Do not worry about tomorrow but seek His kingdom first. 

+ Faithfully serve God and vigilantly wait for Jesus' second coming. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The ignorant rich stored up things for himself to enjoy but didn't know his life was in God's hand. What am I pursuing? Does it have an eternal value? 

+ **Identity** - Am I worried about tomorrow and meeting the needs of daily life? Ask God for His guidance in getting closer to Him and finding peace and fulfillment in His promises.
