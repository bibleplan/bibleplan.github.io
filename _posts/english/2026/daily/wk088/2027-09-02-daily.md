Are leaders of church custodians or servants?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul reminded the Corinthians to not judge but wait for the second coming of Christ. 

+ Paul warned those who puff up themselves and belittle of others. 

+ Paul taught and disciplined the church as a father to his children to unite and look up to Christ. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Have I ever judged others? Ask the Lord to help me not to judge and wait for Jesus' second coming. 

+ **Integrity** - Am I able to withstand the test of fire for what I build atop the foundation?
