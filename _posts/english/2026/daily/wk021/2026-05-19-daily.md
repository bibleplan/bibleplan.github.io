### Question     
What tribes were the next to receive land?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The two tribes of Joseph's descend were next to receive their allotments: Ephraim and half tribe of Manasseh. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Ephraim was mentioned first in getting their inheritance even though Manasseh was Joseph's firstborn, because Jacob had put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh (Gen. 48:20). God elected us, the weak, and made us strong. How do I identify myself in Christ Jesus?
