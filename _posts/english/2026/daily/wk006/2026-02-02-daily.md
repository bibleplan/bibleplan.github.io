### Question     
How was Israel in Egypt?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Israel settled in Egypt. Joseph continued to serve faithfully and used his power to save even more people. Israel made Jacob promise to take him back to the land where his fathers rest. Israel blessed Joseph's two sons. 

+ Although he died in Egypt, Israel was full of hope and faithful to God's promises. God never fails to fulfill his promises. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Israel worshiped God even on his death bed. There's never an end in walking with God. When do I worship Him? Pray to God to help me follow Him every second of my life. 

+ **Identity** - Joseph loved God with all his heart but according to Israel's blessing, God did not elect his tribe as the tribe of Kings. We might believe that Joseph deserved more. Do I often question why some of the Godlier Christians never get blessed with worldly riches? How do I view and submit to God's sovereignty?
