### Question     
When did the promise of being righteous through faith come about?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Galatian believers received their salvation through faith, not law. 

+ The promise of being credited righteous by faith was given before the law. We don't receive grace through law. 

+ Law is to prepare us, as our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. 

+ The spiritual growth of the Galatian church proved that they did so through faith not through law. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - As the Galatian believers, our salvation and our spiritual growth proved that righteousness is gained through faith, not through law. Reflect to the day I became a believer and throughout my life, how God's grace and blessings were given to me through my faith, not my conduct?
