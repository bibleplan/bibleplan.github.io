### Question     
How did the disciples follow the commands Jesus gave before He was risen into heaven?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus instructed the disciples to wait in Jerusalem to be baptized by the Holy Spirit. 

+ The disciples selected new apostle to replace Judas. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - As Jesus left the disciples, they prayed and waited for the Holy Spirit. Do I seek for God's guidance and direction while waiting? 

+ **Integrity** - The first thing came to the disciples' minds, when they realized Jesus' authority in resurrection, was their own desire for the kingdom of Israel instead of the will of Jesus. This is a great reminder for myself: do not be limited by my own limited mind but seek God's will!
