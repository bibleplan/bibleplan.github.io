### Question     
What did the great prostitute represent?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls showed John the punishment of the great prostitute who sat by many waters. 

+ The beast would come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. 

+ Those who gave power and authority to the beast would wage war against the Lamb, but the lamb would triumph over them. 

+ The woman was the great city that rules over the kings of the earth. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Those who gave power and authority to the beast would wage war against the Lamb, but the lamb would triumph over them because he is king of kings, the Lord of lords, and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers, will be victorious. How does knowing the identity of the Lamb help me when I face the spiritual war?
