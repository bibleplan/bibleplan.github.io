### Question     
What did the disciples not understand about Jesus?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus sent out the twelve to preach. Jesus had compassion on the crowd as sheep without shepherd. 

+ The disciples still did not understand and had doubt about Jesus' identity and the miracles He performed. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The disciples cried out and thought He was a ghost when they saw Jesus walking on the lake. Do I know my savior Lord Jesus Christ? Do I still doubt His ability? 

+ **Integrity** - Jesus said, "It is what comes out of a person that defiles them." Do I have any evil thoughts that need to be extinguished by God? Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to light up every nooks and crannies of my heart.
