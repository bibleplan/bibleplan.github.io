### Question     
What change did Jerusalem experience?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The dignified people of Jerusalem became obscure, the loved became despised, the master became slave, and the merciful became cruel all because of the suffering. 

+ The people of Jerusalem looked for their allies to save them in vain. Their king, the Lord's anointed, whom they relied on was captured and unable to save himself. 

+ But the Lord's salvation would come, those who oppress His people would be punished. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - It was a great challenge to Jerusalem's identity for what she had experienced. Even though, she held firm believe that by God, the "exile for her sins will end at last." Where did that faith come from? How does it remind me and help me face the environment and the ever-changing circumstances I'm in?
