### Question     
What is the purpose of the spiritual gifts from God?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Spiritual gifts are given to individuals by the will of the Holy Spirit. 

+ We are all members of one body, baptized by one Spirit into one body, and all made to drink into the one spirit. 

+ Without love and not used to benefit others, gifts, no matter how great, are nothing. 

+ What we know and what we prophesize are limited. Only when that which is perfect has come, then there will be no more limits. 

+ It is a spiritual gift to be able to speak in tongues but it is of no benefit if the listener cannot understand. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - What is love? Am I loving my Christian brothers and sisters by God's standard? 

+ **Fidelity** - Every member of the body has their unique gifts. What are my spiritual gifts? Am I willing to benefit the church with my gifts?
