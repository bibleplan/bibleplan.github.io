### Question     
Why did Paul raise the question of covering and supper?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ It was a tradition of the time to wear head covering.  Paul suggested women of the period should cover their heads. 

+ Remember the Lord and examine oneself during the Lord's Supper before eating the bread and drinking the cup. 

+ When eating together, we ought to wait for each other. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Do I dress appropriately in church? Would the way I dress cause others to stumble? 

+ **Integrity** - Am I willing to follow Lord's authority and priority?
