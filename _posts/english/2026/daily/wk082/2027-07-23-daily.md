### Question     
How did Judas betray Jesus?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus left with His disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and He and His disciples went into it. 

+ Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers. They arrested Jesus and bound him. 

+ Peter's first denial.  

+ Peter's second and third denials. 

+ Jesus tried before Pilate. Pilate found no basis for a charge against Jesus. 

+ The Jews did not want to release Jesus but would rather release Barabbas, who had taken part in an uprising. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus said He came to testify for the truth but Pilate retorted, "What is truth?" Do I believe there's one absolute truth? What is my standard for truth?
