### Question     
What is the way to the Father?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus said His father's house has many rooms and that He is to prepare a place for His disciples. 

+ Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." 

+ Jesus would ask the Father, and to give us another advocate, the Spirit of truth. 

+ Whoever has Jesus' commands and keeps them is the one who loves Him. 

+ The Holy Spirit will teach the disciples all things. 

+ Jesus said, "I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener." 

+ Jesus said, "If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in his love." 

+ Jesus said, "You do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus tells us, whoever believes in Him will do the works He has been doing, and He will do whatever we ask in His name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. God promise to give what we ask, because we will do what Jesus does. Are my prayers following Jesus' will?
