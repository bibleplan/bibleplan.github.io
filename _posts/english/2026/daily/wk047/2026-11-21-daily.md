### Question     
How was Isaiah commissioned by the Lord?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the year that King Uzziah died, Isaiah saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne. Above him were seraphim. 

+ Isaiah thought of woe to himself for he knew he was a man of unclean lips and live among a people of unclean lips. 

+ The seraphim flew to him with a live coal and with it he touched his mouth to take away his sin. 

+ Isaiah answered the Lord's calling. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Isaiah though of his own sin in front of the holy throne of the Lord. How do we, the believers in the age of the New Testament, feel differently from him? Why? 

+ **Fidelity** - Isaiah said: "Here am I. Send me!" to answer the Lord's calling. Am I ready to answer God the same way? What would stop me from doing so?
