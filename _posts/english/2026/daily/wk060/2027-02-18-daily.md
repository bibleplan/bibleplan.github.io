What detestable things did Israel do in God's house?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, the hand of the Sovereign Lord came on Ezekiel. 

+ In a vision from God, Ezekiel was taken by God to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood. 

+ On the walls of the inner court were all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel. 

+ At the entrance of the north gate of the house of the Lord, women sat there mourning the god Tammuz. 

+ At the inner court of the house of the Lord, and there at the entrance to the temple, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east. 

+ Therefore, God would deal with them in anger. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The leaders of Jerusalem thought the Lord does not see them; the Lord has forsaken the land. Do I often follow my own will thinking that God does not see me? Pray and ask God for forgiveness.
