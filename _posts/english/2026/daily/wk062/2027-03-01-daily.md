### Question     
How would the Lord judge Jerusalem?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord would draw His sword from its sheath and cut off from Israel both the righteous and the wicked. 

+ The Lord said there would be a sword against the people and all the princes of Israel. 

+ The profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose time of punishment has reached its climax. 

+ The day has come for the wicked Ammonites, their time of punishment has reached its climax. 

+ Jerusalem brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst. 

+ The people of Israel have become dross to the Lord. He would melt them with a fiery blast inside the city. 

+ The Lord's judgment came to the priests and prophets who profaned the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - The Lord said, I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one. In this sinful world, is there someone who would build up the wall and stand in the gap?
