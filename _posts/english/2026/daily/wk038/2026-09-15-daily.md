{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 

+ God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 

+ Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the Lord struck him down and he died. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Was king Abijah serving the Lord with all his heart and all his soul? What part of his life was pleasing to the Lord and what wasn't?
