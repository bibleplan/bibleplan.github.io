{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Those who aspire to be overseers or deacons must desire noble tasks. 

+ The overseers need to manage well his family and marriage; Have integrity in life, love God and love others, and be blameless both inside and out of the church; Must be mature in faith and be tested in life. 

+ Deacons, men or women, must manage well in their family and marriage, control their tongues, love God's word, be faithful to the Lord. 

+ Serving is not just doing the works, but also benefits in building one's faith and life's integrity. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Verse 3:13 explains that serving is not just doing the works. Faithful service would cause one's faith and life's integrity to grow. Reflect on my services, what was my past attitude toward them? What is my current attitude? Have I received blessings and grown in my spiritual life? 

+ **Integrity** - God puts great emphasis on serving our own family and children. Family and marriage are the forefronts of our services. Where in my spiritual life I am positioning my family and marriage? Do I need to make any adjustment to my priorities?
