### Question     
Who is the source of the unlawful before the Lord's coming?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ There will be signs, there will be people turning away from God, and the coming of their leader, the man of sin, before the Lord's coming. So, do not be troubled or worried when some say the Lord has already come. 

+ Satan will use this man of sin. He will do strange things and many powerful works that will be false. All who do not believe in the Lord will be guilty when they stand before God. 

+ When the Lord comes, He brings the end to the man of sin. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - We are in the age of time's end and there are those who pronounce the Christ is already here. How should we face them according to Paul? The man of sin will come and do strange and powerful things. But nothing can take away the salvation and those who turned away from God would have no excuses because God's plan will be accomplished. Where have you experienced God's sovereignty?
