### Question     
What hope does the promise of the Lord's coming brings to those who are suffering?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The faith stays strong in those who are suffering because God wants them to prove themselves to be worthy in His holy nation. 

+ God does what is right and will allow trouble to come to those who are making it hard for the sufferers. He will help those who are suffering. 

+ God will bring His righteous judgement when the Lord comes again. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God wants the believers to suffer for His holy nation. We might not be facing persecution, but there are other forms of suffering. Can I think of some examples? The promise of the Lord's coming is not just to let us to be with Him forever, but also brings glory to the faithful and punishments to those who refuse Him. From the above question about suffering examples for His holy nation, how does His promise help believers rejoice in hope and endurance?
