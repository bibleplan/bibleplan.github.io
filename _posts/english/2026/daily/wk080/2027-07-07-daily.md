Who is Jesus?  
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 

+ God sent John as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 

+ The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us, full of grace and truth. 

+ John testified concerning Him. 

+ Out of His fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. 

+ For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus Christ for our salvation, the Word became flesh, dwells among us, full of grace and truth. Am I willing to follow Jesus' example, dwell in this world and be a disciple full of grace and truth?
