### Question     
How did John the Baptist testify for Jesus?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ John said he was not the Messiah. 

+ He was the voice of one calling in the wilderness: "Make straight the way for the Lord." In the words of Isaiah the prophet. 

+ John called Jesus the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 

+ John saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. He testified that this is God's Chosen One. 

+ Two of John's disciples followed Jesus. 

+ Jesus called Philip and Nathanael to follow Him. 

+ Nathanael declared: "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel." 

+ In Cana, Jesus turned water into wine. This was the first of the signs through which He revealed His glory. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Nathanael declared Jesus is the Son of God. What do I do to testify for Jesus, the Son of God?
