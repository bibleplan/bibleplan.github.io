### Question     
How did Habakkuk's life change through his conversion with God?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Prophet Habakkuk calls on the Lord for help, but He does not listen. He cries out violence to the Lord but He does not save. 

+ The Lord raising up the Babylonians as judgment. 

+ Habakkuk asked the Lord, why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves? 

+ The Lord answers, the righteous person will live by his faithfulness, but woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain, gives drink to his neighbors till they are drunk, trusts idols of his own creation that cannot speak. 

+ Habakkuk stand in awe of the Lord's deed, waits patiently for the day of calamity. The Sovereign Lord is my strength; He makes my feet like the feet of a deer, He enables me to tread on the heights. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Habakkuk truthfully asked the Lord of his doubt and continued to seek answers until he could understand. How does a prayer like this inspire me?
