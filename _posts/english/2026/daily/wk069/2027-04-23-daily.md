### Question     
Why was Nineveh being judged?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ A prophecy concerning Nineveh. 

+ The Lord is a jealous and avenging God. The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. 

+ The Lord is good but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh; He will pursue His foes into the realm of darkness. 

+ Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away. 

+ Woe to the city of blood. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be destroyed and pass away. Looking at the world surrounding me, how do I see God's plan unfolding?
