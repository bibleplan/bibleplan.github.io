### Question     
Why did the prophet praise in the Lord's name?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore, a curse consumes the earth. 

+ They shout for joy to acclaim the Lord's majesty. From the ends of the earth we hear singing: "Glory to the Righteous One." 

+ The Lord Almighty will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before its elders-with great glory. 

+ The prophet praise in the name of the Lord for His righteousness, grace, and salvation. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The prophet praised in the name of the Lord because people await Him and He will rescue them. The people will shout for joy. Do I often shout for joy in God's salvation?
