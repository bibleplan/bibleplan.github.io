### Question     
What were the horrors of Babylon’s destruction?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ A prophecy against Babylon. Babylon has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground! 

+ A prophecy against Dumah. A prophecy against Arabia. 

+ Weep bitterly for Jerusalem will be destroyed. Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for. 

+ Tyre will be forgotten. The Lord will deal with Tyre at the end of seventy years and her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** – When the Lord makes the men cry, they rejoiced instead, and therefore their sins will not be atoned for. The Lord values our repentant heart. Is there anything I need to repent to the Lord?
