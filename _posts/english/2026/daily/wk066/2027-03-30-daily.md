### Question     
When will Daniel's prophecy be realized?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The words of prophecy are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end. 
+ Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. 
+ None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand. 
### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Daniel's prophecy will not be realized in his time but rolled up and sealed until the time of the end. Where's my hope? Do I have faith in future, that I will rise to receive my allotted inheritance?
