### Question     
When will the promise of descendants be fulfilled?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Continues the theme of promise, God's messengers pointed out the time when Sarah would give birth. 

+ Like Abraham, Sarah laughed at the promise. However, this time God reproached Sarah in addition to reaffirming the promise. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God reaffirmed his promise repeatedly to strengthen Abraham's faith. Do I remember God's promise to me? Ask God to strengthen my faith and keep me focused on His promise. 

+ **Integrity** - There's nothing God cannot accomplish. Am I facing insurmountable difficulties? Remind myself of God's promise, omnipotence, and love. 

+ **Fidelity** - Abraham served as servant to the three man who appeared before him. How am I reminded by his attitude? How can I serve those whom God has placed beside me today?
