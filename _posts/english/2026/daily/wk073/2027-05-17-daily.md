### Question     
What made those on the boat see Jesus as the Son of God?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The suspicion on Jesus' identity and the discussion on His wisdom and abilities intensified. 

+ Jesus fed five thousand, walked on water, and those on the boat worshiped Him as the Son of God. 

+ The pharisees challenged Jesus with ancestor's traditions. Jesus pointed out to them that they broke God's command for the sake of the tradition. 

+ Jesus continued to heal more, fed four thousand, and the people were amazed and praised the God of Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - As Jesus began to reveal His true identity, some were more doubtful and refused Him while others got to know Him deeper. How did God lead me to know Him deeper? Did I ever refuse Him? How did God bring me out from the dead end?
