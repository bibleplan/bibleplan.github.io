### Question     
How is the joy brought about by God's vengeance?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord is angry with all nations. He will totally destroy them, for the Lord has a day of vengeance. 

+ The desert and the parched land will be glad; people will see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God. 

+ Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. 

+ Those the Lord has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - On the day of the Lord's vengeance, the Israelites will look in the scroll of the Lord and read. Do I place God's word in highest priority not just in time of desperation, but in time of peace and when all things are going smoothly, so that His word may be my strength every day?
