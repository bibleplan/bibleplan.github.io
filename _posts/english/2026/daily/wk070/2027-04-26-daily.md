### Question     
To whom did Zephaniah prophesy to?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah during the reign of Josiah king of Judah. 

+ The Lord will stretch out His hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. He will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place. 

+ The day of the Lord is near, He will punish the officials and the king's sons. 

+ That day will be a day of wrath, a day of distress, and a day of battle cry against the fortified cities and against corner towers. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath. What do I value the most? What do I lean on?
