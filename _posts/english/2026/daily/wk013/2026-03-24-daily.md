### Question     
How did God make Israel a kingdom of priests?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Chapter 3 starts in Genesis like fashion with the lineage of the Levites. 

+ God established the kingdom of priests as the works for the tribe of Levi were around the Tabernacle signifying God's covenant with Israelites and His presence. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Reference Genesis 49 and Exodus 32. Levites loved God and offered themselves to God. Now God took the Levites as substitute for all Israelite firstborns to serve Him. Likewise, when we turn to God, we are offering ourselves to Him and serve Him. Think about the transformation God has done for my life.
