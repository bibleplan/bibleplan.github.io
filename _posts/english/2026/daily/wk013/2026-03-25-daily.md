### Question     
How did God make Israelites the holy nation?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God called the Israelites to become His holy nation. 

+ The laws to keep the Israelites clean: 

+ Restitution for wrongs: to keep Israelites united.

+ Holy marriage: to keep the descendants clean. 

+ Nazirites: a special testimony to God's calling.

+ Aaron's blessing: Reaffirmed God's promises and pointed the Israelites to the promised land.

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - God made the Israelites His and established laws and rules on restitution to keep them united. Do I value the unity of Christians or am I damaging it? 

+ **Fidelity** - God put great emphasis on fidelity in marriage. Do I value my marriage as holy and being faithful to my spouse?
