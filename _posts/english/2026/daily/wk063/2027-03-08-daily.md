### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Said to the Pharaoh the beauty of Assyria was given into the hand of the nations by God for it was proud of its height.  

+ Prophesy against Pharaoh that he would go with Assyria down in the earth below among the killed. 

+ Take up a lament concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt, the sword of the king of Babylon would come against him, the pride of Egypt would shatter, and all hordes overthrown. 

+ Wail for the daughters of Egypt. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Why was the tall cedar judged and cut down? What does it remind me of?
