### Question     
How was Jesus tried and crucified?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Jews would rather release Barabbas but not Jesus while He was being tried before Pilate. 

+ Jesus died of crucifixion. The curtain in the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Tearing of the curtain in the temple signifies the gap between God and mankind had been cleansed with Jesus' blood. Can I come willingly and fearlessly in front of Jesus to off load all my worries and burdens to Him?
