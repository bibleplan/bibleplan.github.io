### Question     
How did the people work together to rebuild the wall?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The people worked together to rebuild the gates in order. 

+ Sanballat became angry and was greatly incensed when he heard that the Israelites were rebuilding the wall. 

+ Sanballat plotted to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it. 

+ The enemies did not come when they heard that the Israelites were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Sanballat was incensed when he heard about the Israelite's plan. Am I discouraged by my own weakness? How may I be strengthened and encouraged? 

+ **Fidelity** - Rebuilding the wall is a long and arduous process. But it was rebuilt in fifty-two days. What does work sharing means to God's kingdom? Are the challenges remaining in my co-working with others?
