### Question     
Why did Nebuchadnezzar tell nations about the signs and wonders of God?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Nebuchadnezzar told nations about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed. 

+ Nebuchadnezzar, had a dream at home in his palace, contented and prosperous. All wise men of Babylon could not interpret it. 

+ Daniel, with the spirit of the holy gods in him, interpreted the dream. 

+ Nebuchadnezzar would be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; would eat grass like the ox. 

+ At the end of that time, Nebuchadnezzar's sanity was restored. Then he praised the Most High; he honored and glorified him who lives forever. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Nebuchadnezzar was driven away for seven years. Was his attitude toward God changed after that time? Do I understand God's good intention when He disciplines me?
