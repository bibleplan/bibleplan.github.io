### Question     
Why would the Lord punish the sinners?

{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The prophet would weep day and night for the slain of people. He would weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the wilderness grasslands. 

+ People have forsaken the law, followed the stubbornness of their hearts, so the Lord will scatter them among nations. 

+ The Lord will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Idols are worthless, the objects of mockery. But our God is the Lord who created everything. Is any worthless object of mockery in my life to tempt me? Am I following the worthless idols and forsake the Almighty God?
