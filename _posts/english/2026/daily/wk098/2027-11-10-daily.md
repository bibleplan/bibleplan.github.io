### Question     
Why is the new covenant superior?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus' ministry is superior as He is the mediator of the superior covenant. 

+ We may reconcile with God only through Jesus as He is the mediator of the new covenant which we shall have faith in. 

+ God writes His laws on man's heart and makes Himself known, forgives his wickedness, and remembers his sins no more. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Do I understand the meaning of "I will be their God, and they will be my people?" Do I often remind myself of my identity as God's people?
