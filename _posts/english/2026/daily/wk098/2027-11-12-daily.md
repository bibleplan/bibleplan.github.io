### Question     
What kind of life does Jesus bring to us by His one sacrifice?
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus' sacrifice removed the curtain to the Most Holy Place so that we may come near God at any time. 

+ Our faith grows to win over the confusion and doubt through Jesus Christ; We are capable of encouraging each other through Jesus Christ; We are able to worship together through Jesus Christ. 

+ Do not stop meeting together; even when being persecuted and suffering. 

+ God will judge those who refuse His grace. 

+ Do not throw away our confidence; we will be richly rewarded. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - The Bible says, "to spur one another on toward love and good deeds." How shall I apply this teaching in my small group?
