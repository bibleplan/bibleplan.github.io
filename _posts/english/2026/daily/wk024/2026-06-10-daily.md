How did Boaz fulfill his responsibility as a guardian-redeemer?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ When one dies, according to the law, a close relative is obligated to redeem his family, marry his wife, and buy his land to maintain the inheritance. Naomi followed this law to find a home for Ruth. Ruth obeyed Naomi's will and Boaz obeyed the law to fulfill his obligation. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - God's grace was realized through Naomi's love, Ruth's obedience, and Boaz's faithfulness. Through me, God's grace may also come to others. What can I learn from Naomi, Ruth, and Boaz's integrity in love, obedience, and faith and apply that to my service to the Lord?
