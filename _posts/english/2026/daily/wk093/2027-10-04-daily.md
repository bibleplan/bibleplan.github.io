### Question     
How should Christians live? 
{% include BibleLinks2026.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Christians shall live in a way that's worthy of the gospel of Christ. Stand firm in the one Spirit and striving together as one for the faith of the gospel. 

+ Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. 

+ Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Pray to God to help me connect with Christ and work together with my fellow Christians in one Spirit so that we may stand firm and, with my new life, being one body in Christ. 

+ **Community** - What in my life is making me proud? Where in me do I see myself being above the others? Pray to God to help me worry less of myself but more of the others.
