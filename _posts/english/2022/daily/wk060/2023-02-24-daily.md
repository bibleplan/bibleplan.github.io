Why was Israel split into two parts, north and south?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Rehoboam was made king in Shechem. 

+ Rehoboam took advice from young men to treat the Israelites harshly caused them to rebel against the house of David. 

+ Jeroboam was made king by the Israelites. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David. 

+ God prevented war between Rehoboam and Israelites. 

+ Jeroboam made two golden calves and brought the people into sin. 

+ A man of God warned Jeroboam that he would be killed by lion if he defies God's command. 

+ Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What was Jeroboam's biggest mistake? Have I worshiped the created more than God? 

+ **Community** - Rehoboam rejected elders' advice but took young men's and caused rebellion. How should I look at the advices from elders? Am I humbly seeking elders' experiences? 

+ **Fidelity** - The Israelites first submitted then rebelled because Rehoboam's improper governing. Leaders have a lot of influences on people. How should I watch my own conduct when I serve?
