### Question     
What did Solomon build next?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ It took Solomon thirteen years to complete the construction of his palace. He also built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 

+ Solomon brought Huram from Tyre to cast bronze pillars, to cast the Sea of cast metal, to make movable bronze stands and bronze basins. 

+ Solomon also made the golden altar and golden tables for the Lord's temple, the golden lampstands and the gold floral works, lamps, tongs, pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers, the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - How much time did Solomon spend on each building the temple and palace? What are the sizes of the temple and palace? How do I think about Solomon's action? How does that remind me to love God with a pure heart? 

+ **Fidelity** - Compare Solomon's temple to Moses' tent of meeting (Exodus 25-27, 30-31.) What were the similarities and differences? What similarities and differences are there in their constructions? How can I serve to please God?
