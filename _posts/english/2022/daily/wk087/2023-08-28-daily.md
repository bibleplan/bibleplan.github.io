### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Prayers express all the sufferings they experienced in front of the Lord. 

+ Prayers admit all that was the consequence of their sins. 

+ Prayers called on God to turn them around to give them joy they used to have. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The prayer to call on God was not to remove the suffering but to repent and to turn themselves around. What do I call on God for in my prayer? What should I pray for?
