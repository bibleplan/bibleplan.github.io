### Question     
What were Ezekiel's signs of Jerusalem's siege?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God commanded Ezekiel to draw out on a block of clay the siege of Jerusalem as a sign to the people of Israel. 

+ God commanded Ezekiel to lie on his left to put the sin of the people of Israel upon himself and to lie on his right to bear the sin of the people of Judah. 

+ God commanded Ezekiel to make bread for himself, to eat the bread and drink water according to the number of days of he was lying on his sides as a sign that the people would be in anxiety as food and water would be scarce and rationed in Jerusalem. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Ezekiel's daily life was under much restriction in order to deliver God's message. When I testify for the Lord, do I feel being restricted? How do I feel about the price I pay for following God?
