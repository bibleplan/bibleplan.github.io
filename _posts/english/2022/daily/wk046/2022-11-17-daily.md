### Question     
How does a spiritual life with faith, hope, and love become witness of gospel?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The gospel of Jesus Christ is not limited to teaching by words but also encompasses the faith given by God through His great power. 

+ A beautiful spiritual life allows others to see the work produced by faith, labor prompted by love, and endurance inspired by hope. 

+ A life imitating the Lord's is the best and the most beautiful witness for Christ's gospel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - We are taught through words the gospel of Jesus Christ. And, we are given the life of Christ for which we may grow into on our way to sanctification through the great transformation power of God and continuous works of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, it is not enough to only learn the spiritual knowledge, but also with humility, lay up our lives to let God destroy the old and build the new. Pray to God to help me commit my life to Him. 

+ **Integrity** - What faith, what love, and what hope does a mature life have? What is work produced by faith? What is labor produced by love? What is endurance inspired by hope? How should I live a life of faith, love, and hope facing the daily challenges and works?
