### Question     
How did Paul testify for the truth under the persecution?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Sadducees' inability to see resurrection proves limitation of human wisdom. 

+ The sign of Lord's protection came again. Paul was transferred to Caesarea while the plot to kill him was being planned. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - For God's truth reveals all fallacies that Paul pointed out the heresy of his accusers even under the great political pressure against him. How should I do more to understand God's way, the only truth? 

+ **Identity** - Even people in high positions such as Felix would be afraid when they hear about righteousness, self-control, and judgement to come. World's definition of success and status won't help us in anyway in God's eternity. The fruit of eternal value comes only from relationship with God.
