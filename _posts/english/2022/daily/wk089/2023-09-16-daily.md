### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord would stretch out His hand against the Ammonites for they rejoiced with all the malice against the land of Israel. 

+ Because Moab and Seir said, "Look, Judah has become like all the other nations," therefore the Lord would expose the flank of its towns. 

+ Because Edom took revenge on Judah, therefore the Lord would stretch out His hand against Edom. 

+ The Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - It is helpful for us to know we are not alone in life's challenges by understanding that the Lord is with us. Pray to the Lord to lift me up and give me the will to follow Him.
