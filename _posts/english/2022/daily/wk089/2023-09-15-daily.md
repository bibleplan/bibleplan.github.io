### Question     
What parable did Ezekiel use as a sign of Samaria and Jerusalem's rebellion?


{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The parable of two adulterous sisters to describe how Samaria and Jerusalem engaged in prostitution and strayed away from God. 

+ The Lord would stir up Oholibah's lovers, those who she turned away from in disgust, against her. 

+ Judge Oholah and Oholibah with their detestable practices. Righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood. 

+ The choice meat in cooking pot as a parable for Jerusalem. 

+ The Lord commanded Ezekiel to not lament, weep, or shed tear for the death of his wife, as a sign for Israelites that their suffering would be so great that they would have no chance to mourn for themselves. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - God cleanses us, but we must play an active role in that process. What role am I playing in the process of purify myself?
