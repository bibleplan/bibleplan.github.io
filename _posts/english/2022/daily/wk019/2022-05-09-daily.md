### Question     
What did God tell the Israelites three months out of Egypt?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Three months after coming out of Egypt, the Israelites received the ten commandments and the instructions for the altars. 

+ God established covenant with the Israelites on the foot of Mount Sinai to remind them that they were to remember God brought them out of Egypt, they were to serve Him, to keep His commands, to worship Him, and to be His people and to purify themselves as His priests. 

+ God gave the Israelites ten commandments. The first four were about God, the rest were about relationship between men. Once again, we realize the law can be summarize as love God and love each other. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God brought the Israelites out of slavery so they could become His people and priests. I am chosen by God to receive His salvation. Do I know that I am also His priest, to be purified, and belong to Him? 

+ **Integrity** - God wanted the Israelites to live faultless lives with the ten commandments. The essence of the ten commandments is to love God and love each other. Am I living out a life that loves God and others?
