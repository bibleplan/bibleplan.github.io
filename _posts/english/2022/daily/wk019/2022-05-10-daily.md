### Question     
What laws did God give after the ten commandments?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God gave Israelites the civil laws. 

+ God set out great details in the civil laws regarding slavery, punishment for violence, compensation for livestock, theft, human rights, justice, festivals, and everything else. From the civil laws, God established a covenant with the Israelites and promised to be with them to enable them to conquer Canaan. 

+ God wanted to make the Israelites holy before Him, not to conform with the Gentiles, to practice obedience, and to learn the holy nature of Himself. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God cares about all our lives. With the civil laws, Israelis could gain a deeper understanding of God's holy nature. Do I often consider the holy nature of God in my journey with Him and aim to live out the holy life on daily basis? 

+ **Community** - The promulgation of the civil law is for the specific needs of Israel at the time. From the laws, we can see that God provided protections for human life and property. God wants people to be fair to each other, respectful and compassionate. How do these understandings help me to get along with others?
