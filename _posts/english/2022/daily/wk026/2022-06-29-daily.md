### Question     
What blessings and protections from God were revealed in the second census?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Israelites' number had not changed much in the 40 years. This was a blessing from God for He promised Abraham's descendants would become a great nation. 

+ God blessed Zelophehad's Daughters for they had the rightful view of their inheritances. 

+ Moses was denied entry into the land of Canaan. He asked God in his last prayer for a new leader who would lead the Israelites into the promised land. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Israelites number changed little after plagues, disasters, killings, and other punishments. God's promises never change because of our weakness. Looking back in my life, do I often see my own failures or God's faithfulness? 

+ **Community** - Moses' heart was with the people even though he was denied entry into the promised land. What can I pray for my family, church, and God's leading in my services?
