### Question     
Why God punishes Israelites of their sins?
{%- include BibleLinks2022.html -%}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God had chosen only Israel of all the families of the earth; therefore He will punish them for all their sins. 
+ The Sovereign Lord has spoken-who can but prophesy? 
+ The Lord warns the descendants of Jacob. On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. 
+ You cows of Bashan, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy. The time will sure come when you will be taken away with hooks. 
+ Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more. 
+ God punished Israel with heavy penalties, and they still don't turn back to Him. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Because God's had chosen only Israel from all the families of the earth; He would punish them for all their sins. God loves His people so much that He put heavy emphasis on their cleanliness and holiness. How does this fact encourage and alert me?
