### Question     
How will the remnant of Israel be blessed?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord revealed Himself to those who did not ask for Him; He was found by those who did not seek Him. To a nation that did not call on His name, He said, "Here am I, here am I." 

+ Judah was forsaken for their unbelieve. The Lord will not keep silent but will pay back in full; He will pay it back into their laps. 

+ The Lord will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess His mountains. 

+ Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the one true God. For the past troubles will be forgotten. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The Israelites often angered God even though they were the chosen people. Today, we as the saved, are still chained by sins and often angers God. Pray to God to examine my heart and remind me to remove my all my sins including those remain hidden.
