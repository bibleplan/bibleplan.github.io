How did the prophet pray to God to bring justice to earth?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In all their distress, the anointed too was distressed. In his love and mercy he redeemed them. 

+ They rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them. 

+ This is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name. Please Look down from heaven and see. 

+ Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you and make your name known to your enemies! 

+ Lord, you are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - While we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away, God is already saving us. The humble and repentant heart will not be taken lightly by Him. Pray to God to have mercy on my weakness, to forgive my wickedness, and let me atone quietly in from of Him.
