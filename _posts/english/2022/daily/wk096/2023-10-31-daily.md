### Question     
How did the possibility of annihilation come about to the Jews?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Mordecai reported the conspiracy of two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king. 

+ Because Mordecai would not kneel down or pay honor to Haman, he was enraged and looked for a way to destroy all Jews. 

+ Haman advised King Xerxes to issue a decree to destroy all Jews while he would give ten thousand talents of silver to the king. The king said to Haman to do with the people as he pleased. 

+ They wrote out commands in the name of King Xerxes to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews, and to plunder their goods. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Mordecai insisted on not kneeling down to Haman, upholding his principle and not to subjugate himself to the social norm. What struggle did Mordecai experience? Can I not submit myself to the society for the truth?
