### Question     
How was the Jews rescued by miracles?


{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Through chronicle, the King learned of Mordecai's honor and recognition he did not receive. 

+ The king ordered Haman to robe Mordecai, lead him on the horse through the city streets, and proclaiming before him, "This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!" 

+ The king asked Esther what her petition and request were. Esther asked the king to save the Jews. 

+ The king impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Haman conspired to kill Mordecai but ended up in giving him the honor and recognition. What do I think about this surprising outcome? How should I view God's control of my life? 

+ **Identity** - Esther did not speak for the Jews immediately but waited for the next day when the king asked her. How would the outcome be different if she had done otherwise? Am I willing to wait for God's timing?
