### Question     
What great honor did Mordecai get?


{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman. Esther appointed Mordecai over Haman's estate. 

+ Esther asked the king to overrule the dispatches that Haman had sent out. The king's edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children, and to plunder the property of their enemies. 

+ The city of Susa held a joyous celebration for Mordecai. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The thirteenth day of the month of Adar turned from a day of annihilation into a day of retribution. How do I view suffering under God's control? 

+ **Fidelity** - For the welfare of the Jews, Esther and Mordecai were not satisfied with honor, recognition, and Haman's execution. Am I willing to other's needs above mine and seek each other's blessings?
