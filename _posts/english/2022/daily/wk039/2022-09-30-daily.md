### Question     
What identity do we receive through the Holy Spirit?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The law of sin causes us to die through the law of righteousness. However, the law of the Spirit releases us in Christ to free us from the law of death. 

+ Through the Holy Spirit, we receive the adoption to sonship as glorious descendants. With Holy Spirit praying for us, God helping us, and with us in Christ, there's nothing can separate us from the love of Christ! 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - We struggle as the law of sin battles in our heart with the law of God. How do I rely on the law of the Spirit to gain freedom in Christ? What does it mean to serve the flesh and to serve the Holy Spirit? Have I experienced fleshly suffering in exchange with peace through the Holy Spirit? 

+ **Identity** - There's nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. Do I see my value in the eyes of God from the description of God's love in verses 8:31-39. Let's remember how God loves us! Have I looked down upon myself due to the influence of the world? Likewise, have I looked down upon others?
