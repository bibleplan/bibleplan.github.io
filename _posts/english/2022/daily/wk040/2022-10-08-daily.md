### Question     
What is wisdom and where does it come from?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul reminded the church of Corinth there should be no division and quarrel. 

+ God wants the church to unite in mind and thought. 

+ God uses the foolish things of the world instead of the wisdom of human to save those who believe. 

+ God does not like those who proclaim to be wise. 

+ God's people are taught His wisdom through the Holy Spirit for the wisdom of human does not understand the mystery of God. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Have I had caused or even thought of division and quarrel? Let me ask God to help me unify with other Christians. 

+ **Integrity** - I am a follower of Christ but still living in the infancy of my spiritual life? Pray and ask God to help me to have a God centered life instead of focusing on the world.
