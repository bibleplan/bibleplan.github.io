### Question     
How does God's election come to the Israelites and the Gentiles?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ There's a remnant of Israelites chosen by God's grace. 

+ Because of the Israelites' transgression, the salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 

+ By the depth and riches of His wisdom and knowledge, God's mercy has come to the Israelites as well as the Gentiles. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God's election is full of His wisdom and knowledge as well as His grace and mercy. We sometimes ask why He elected those who seemed wicked but not those who look to be moral. What does passage on the wisdom of His election remind and inspire me? 

+ **Integrity** - They were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. Do I look down on those who don't believe because I feel being superior? What does God's warning remind me of?
