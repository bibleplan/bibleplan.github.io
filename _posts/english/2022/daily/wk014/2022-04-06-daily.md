### Question     
God promised a land to Abraham. What would the sinful land which did not please Him become?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The becoming of the land, people, and nation that were not pleasing to God. 

+ As God going to judge Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham pleaded to God for them. Lot protected the angels and the angels led him out of Sodom. Lot's daughter got their descendant through their own way. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Although Lot has learned God's mind; his wife ignored the warning and looked back; his daughters got descendants through their own way. How does Lot's story remind me of? How should I build a Godly family? 

+ **Fidelity** - Abraham pleaded to God for the sinful Sodom. What can I do for our sinful world today?
