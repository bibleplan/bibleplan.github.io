### Question     
What happened before the seventh trumpet sounded?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Another angel came down from heaven holding a little scroll. Seven thunders spoke, ordered John not to write it down. 

+ God told John to eat the scroll. It would turn his stomach sour but as sweet as honey in his mouth. 

+ John was given a reed like a measuring rod to measure the temple of God and the altar with its worshipers. 

+ Two witnesses clothed in sackcloth would prophesy for 1,260 days. They would be killed, then after three and a half days, the life from God would enter them. 

+ The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - When the two prophets were killed, the inhabitants of the earth would celebrate and send gift to each other because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth. How do I view pain and joy? Does God give me pain or true joy?
