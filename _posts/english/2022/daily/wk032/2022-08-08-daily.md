### Question     
Which tribe was the first to receive land?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Caleb and the tribe of Judah were the first to receive inheritance indicating the significance of the tribe. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The tribe of Judah was the first to receive the inheritance some hundred years after God promised Abraham and Jacob. Being children of God, we have the inheritance of grace in Jesus Christ. Pray for myself and fellow Christians to give thanks to the Lord for the spiritual home and the identity of being Children of God. 

+ **Fidelity** - Caleb co-worked with Joshua for forty years. At age eighty-five, he asked Joshua to give him the hill country occupied by Anakites in their fortified cities because he had faith that God will help him drive out the Anakites. Do I often lax in my services and lust in self-indulgence because I feel I have done enough? Do I serve according to my ability or God's promise?
