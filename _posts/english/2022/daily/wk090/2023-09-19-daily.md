### Question     
What was the result of Tyre king's pride?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The ruler of Tyre pride himself as a god. God would bring foreigner against it. They would draw their swords against its beauty and wisdom. They would bring it down to the pit and it would die in the heart of the seas. 

+ The Lord commanded the prophet to take up a lament concerning Tyre, its heart became proud on account of its beauty, and the Lord would throw it to the earth. 

+ The Lord commanded the prophet to prophesy against Sidon, the Lord was against Sidon, He would inflict punishment on it. 

+ The Lord would gather the people of Israel from the nations where they have been scattered, He would be proved holy through them in the sight of the nations, then they will live in the land which the Lord gave to Jacob. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Tyre king thought of himself as god because of his pride. Is the wealth I have today from my own work or given by God? Am I thankful for God's provision? What does the fate of Tyre king remind me of?
