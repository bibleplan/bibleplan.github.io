### Question     
How was Jeremiah being laughed at?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The priest Pashhur, the official in charge of the temple of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying so he had Jeremiah beaten and put in the stocks at the Lord's temple then released the next day. 

+ Jeremiah said to Pashhur that the Lord would make him a terror to himself and to all his friends. 

+ The prophet cried to the Lord that he was being ridiculed all day long, mock by everyone, and with terror all around. 

+ The prophet knew the Lord was with him, his persecutors will stumble and not prevail. 

+ The prophet was willing to be cursed the day he was born, mocked by everyone, and end his days in shame. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - The Lord's word in the prophet's heart was like fire shut up in his bones, he was weary of holding it in. Do I have the same zeal as the prophet with the Lord's word and would spread the gospel like it is burning in my heart?
