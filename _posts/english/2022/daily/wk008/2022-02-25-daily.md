### Question     
How may one persevere to wait for the Kingdom of God?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus healed ten lepers.

+ Jesus taught what to expect when the Kingdom of God comes. 

+ How should one pray in front of God. 

+ The cost of following God. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Only one of the ten lepers healed by Jesus came back to give thanks to God. Do I often remember the healing and salvation of Jesus and start each day by giving thanks to Him? 

+ **Identity** - It is revealed that our hearts are tarnished by the worldly temptations and values when Jesus said: "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!" Reflect on the effects of the worldly material temptation has on me and how has it impeded me to devote myself fully to Jesus?
