### Question     
Who is Christ? Do you know Him?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Christ is prophet, high priest, king, and all of God's mysteries. 

+ Christ is the Son of God, is the radiance of the glorious God, is the exact representation of God's being, and superior to the angels. 

+ Christ is the creator and through Him the universe was made. 

+ God is the one in control that the universe follows His plan, not to the left, not to the right. Jesus is the appointed heir of all things. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Think about the miracle of God's creation and my understanding of His glory with the knowledge that Jesus is the creator of the universe. How does this affect my identity and value?
