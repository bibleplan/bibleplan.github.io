### Question     
How did the Holy Spirit lead the apostles to bring gospel to Europe?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Holy Spirit lead the apostles to preach in Europe. 

+ In Philippi, Lydia was converted near the river. The apostles praised God in prison and the jailer with his family were baptized. 

+ Many believed in Thessalonica. 

+ Many received the message with great eagerness in Berea. 

+ Through the inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD, Paul proclaimed God's truth. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Although imprisoned, Paul and Silas sang songs praising God and prayed because it was a natural outpouring of their lives that were immersed in Holy Spirit. Can I trust God's intention is all for my wellbeing even when I'm surrounded by difficulties? Pray and ask God to help me believe Him not just in prosperity, but in adversity, too! 

+ **Fidelity** - Despite the distractions everywhere they went, the apostles had always prioritized gospel preaching according to the needs of the unbelievers. How does the way the apostles preached inspire me?
