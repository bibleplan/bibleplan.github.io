### Question     
How did God's salvation plan continue among the nations?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The fifth segment of Adam and Eve's the family history. The account of Shem's family. 

+ This history connects Abram (Abraham), the ancestor of Israel, to Noah's son Shem and the history of the world. In another word, it connects the history of man's downfall to God's salvation plan. Luke 3:34-36 reminds us the importance of this family for their offspring Abraham would bring blessings to all people. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God saves the people of His election. Do I know I am of the elected? 

+ **Fidelity** - Can God use me to bring salvation to those people I know, such as family, friends, or co-workers?
