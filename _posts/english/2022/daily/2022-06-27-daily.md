### Question     
Why Balaam blessed Israelites when Balak wanted him to curse them?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Moab wasn't their target when the Israelites came to camp across from Jericho. Balak summoned Balaam to curse the Israelites but God made him to bless them instead. 

+ Balaam was not a prophet. He seemingly proclaimed himself a prophet was in fact a spokesperson for all false gods. He was condemned many times in Bible for his immorality, injustice, and low ethics. (Num. 31:7-8,15-16, Deu. 23:3-6; Jos. 13:22;24:9-10; Neh.13:1-3;Mic. 6:5;2 Peter 2:15-16; Jude 11; Rev. 2:14) 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Why did Balaam changed locations and the ways to curse the Israelites? How was God's power shown through Balaam's failures? 

+ **Identity** - God intervened and protected Israelites when Balak summoned Balaam to curse them. God always protects without us knowing. Let me count the blessings I received last week and know they were from God, not myself.
