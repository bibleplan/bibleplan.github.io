### Question     
How is God's promise to renew like?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ A king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice. 

+ A prophecy of Judah's ruin, till the Spirit is poured on us from on high. 

+ Those who destroy will be destroyed, those who betray will be betrayed. 

+ Those who walk righteously and speak what is right are the ones who will dwell on the heights, whose refuge will be the mountain fortress. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Pray to the Lord to be my strength every morning, my salvation in time of distress. Prayer to God is not only a cry for help, it is also a path to know Him better. How is my prayer life? How often do I pray?
