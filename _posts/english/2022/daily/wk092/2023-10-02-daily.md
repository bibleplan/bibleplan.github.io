### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Allot the land as an inheritance, present to the Lord a portion of the land as a sacred district, the entire area will be holy. 

+ Give the city as its property an area adjoining the sacred portion; it will belong to all Israel. 

+ The prince will have the land bordering each side of the area formed by the sacred district and the property of the city, running lengthwise parallel to one of the tribal portions. 

+ The decrees for the princes. 

+ The decrees for the people. 

+ The decrees for the princes' inheritance. 

+ The decrees for the priests to cook the offerings. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The temple and holy city located in the center of Israel is central to Israelites' life, because it is the place where God lives. Is God living in my heart? How can it be seen?
