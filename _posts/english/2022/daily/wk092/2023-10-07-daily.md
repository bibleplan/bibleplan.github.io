### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams and ordered his men to tell him what he had dreamed. 

+ The astrologers answered the king, there is no one on earth who can do what king asks! 

+ The king was so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. 

+ Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him. 

+ Daniel and his friends plead for mercy from the God concerning this mystery. 

+ Daniel answered the king that God reveals mysteries and He has shown king Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. 

+ Daniel spoke of the king's dream, before the king stood a large statue. 

+ Daniel explained the meaning of the dream. 

+ The king Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrated before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. 

+ The king placed Daniel in a high position and made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon. 

### Meditation: My Story
