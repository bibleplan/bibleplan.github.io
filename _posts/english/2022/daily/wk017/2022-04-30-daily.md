### Question     
What did God do when Pharaoh failed to let the Israelites leave?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God told Moses and Aaron that He would multiply His signs and wonders in Egypt so they would know He is the Lord. 

+ Pharaoh would not obey God to let Israelites leave after being warned repeatedly. His heart hardened after each plague. His stubbornness brought destructions to his people and country. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - It is necessary to overcome the bondage of the world to live a Godly life. In Moses' time, it was the Pharaoh. Today, it is money, work, and many other challenges. What did I learn from today's passage to face these challenges? 

+ **Fidelity** - Moses repeatedly asked Pharaoh to "let my people go." Moses might have felt frustrated and defeated but he continued to obey and serve God. Can I continue to obey and serve God faithfully like Moses when facing difficult struggles repeatedly?
