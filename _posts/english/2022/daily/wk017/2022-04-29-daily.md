### Question     
How did the first meeting between Moses, Aaron, and Pharaoh go?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Pharaoh laid more burden on Israelites after the first meeting with Moses and Aaron. God might allow many unreasonable things to happen but through them, we get to know better God's power, faith, righteousness, and love. 

+ Israelites complained to Moses because they had to do more works. God restated His promise and let Moses know His faith and love to the Israelites. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - God let Aaron to help Moses because he spoke with faltering lips. Do I seek help from others with different gifts, so we can form a unified spiritual team to serve God?  

+ **Fidelity** - Israelites bad mouthed Moses when He obeyed God's will. While serving, what should I do when facing complaints? What can I learn from the interactions between Moses and God?
