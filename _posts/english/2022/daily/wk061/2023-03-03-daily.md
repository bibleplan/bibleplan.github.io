### Question     
What was Ahab's attitude toward God's discipline for him?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ By his own will, Ahab solicited Judah king Jehoshephat's help to go to war against the Aramean. Ahab loved to hear the good prophecies but never listened to bad prophecies from the true prophet of the Lord and even put him into prison. 

+ The Lord made true the prophecy He put into the mouth of His prophet. Ahab died on battlefield, his chariot was washed at a pool, and the dogs licked his blood, as the word of the Lord had declared. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - It might sound uncomfortable and piercing to the ears when God reminds us but the voice of Satan is always sweet like honey. How have I, in my experiences, distinguished the voice of God through circumstances and those around me from the sweet voice of Satan? 

+ **Fidelity** - Judah king Jehoshaphat repeatedly suggested Ahab to ask Micaiah of God's will even though Ahab did no like him. However, Jehoshaphat did not attempt to persuade Ahab to submit to God's will and continue to join Ahab in war. How may I faithfully serve God to the unbelievers and go beyond performing lip services?
