### Question     
How did Elijah defeat the false prophets of Baal?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In the third year, the Lord told Elijah to present himself to Ahab to rebuke him for abandoning the Lord's commands to follow Baals. 

+ Elijah battled the Baal's false prophets on Mount Carmel. The false prophets were defeated and slaughtered. 

+ Jezebel wanted to kill Elijah. Elijah escaped to Beersheba in Judah. The Lord whispered gently to Elijah told him to go to the Desert of Damascus to anoint Hazael king over Aram, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed Elijah as prophet. 

+ God had reserved seven thousand in Israel-all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal. 

+ Elijah called Elisha to follow him. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - What attributes did God display when he gently whispered to Elijah? How am I hearing God's voice today? 

+ **Identity** - Elijah rebuked the people for wavering between two opinions: "If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." Am I wavering between two opinions and not following God completely? 

+ **Fidelity** - How did Elijah respond when called by God? How am I responding and submitting to God's will?
