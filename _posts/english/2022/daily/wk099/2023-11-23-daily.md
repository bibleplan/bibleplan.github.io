### Meditation: God's Story   
+ We are elected by the grace of the one true Triune God. 

+ This salvation gives us new life and living hope as well as the inheritance in heaven. 

+ Through trials, faith may be proven to be genuine that may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. 

+ This salvation was revealed and pointed to the prophets, through their search with greatest care, and angels as well as those who have preached the gospel to us by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God in three persons did the wonder. What were their works? What do these works mean to me? God's salvation gives us new life and living hope as well as the inheritance in heaven. What is the new life to me? How am I now different from the old self? Have others observed any difference in me? What is my hope? What is living hope? 

+ **Integrity** - There is glorious joy in all kinds of trials. From this and surrounding passages, what is the source of this glorious joy? What is this glorious joy? Have I seen examples of this glorious joy? Have I experienced such glorious joy?
