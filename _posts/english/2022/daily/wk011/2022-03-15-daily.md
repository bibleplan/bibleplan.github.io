### Question     
Why did Jesus wait two days before seeing Lazarus?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ A man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany. 

+ When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it." 

+ Jesus went to Lazarus. He knew he was dead and had already been in the tomb for four days. 

+ Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die." 

+ When Jesus saw the Jews were weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. Jesus wept. 

+ Jesus said, "If you believe, you will see the glory of God." 

+ Jesus looked up, prayed, and called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!" The dead man came out. 

+ The Pharisees plotted to kill Jesus ever since. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** -Martha and Mary asked Jesus to help. They both said the same thing, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." However, Jesus replied to them in two different ways. Why? How does Jesus remind me when caring for others?
