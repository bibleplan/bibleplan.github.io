### Question     
What conflicts did Jesus have with the elders, the teachers of the laws, and the chief priests at the temple?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus cleansed the temple. 

+ Jesus used the parable of the tenants to illustrate the loss of Israel's blessing. 

+ Jesus used paying taxes to Caesar to explain the relationship between religion and political power. 

+ Jesus predicted destruction of the temple and redemption belongs to those who endures.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** -Learning from Israel's loss of its blessing as depicted in the parable of the tenants, how should we value our own identity? Do I deserve the blessings and salvation from Jesus? Can I put thankfulness back into my heart? 

+ **Fidelity** - The two small copper coins from the poor widow was more than what all others gave. Am I giving my all to serve God? What reservations do I have?
