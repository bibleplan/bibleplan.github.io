### Question     
How did the Israelites make a covenant with God?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and putting dust on their heads. They confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors. 

+ The Levites praised the Lord that He created everything and delivered Israel time after time. 

+ They confessed their sins against the Lord. 

+ In view of all this, they made a binding agreement, put it in writing, and affixed their seals to it. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Why did the people fast? What does it mean for the confession of their sins? Through prayers, do I have a better understanding of my spiritual identity and original sins?  

+ **Identity** - What does it mean to Israelites' understanding of God by looking back in history? Do I often look at God's blessing from the past so I may know better God's will?
