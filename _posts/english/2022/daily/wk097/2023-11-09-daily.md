### Question     
What did Nehemiah do after the completion of reconstructing the wall?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After the wall had been rebuilt and doors were set in place, the gatekeepers, the musicians and the Levites were appointed. 

+ Hanani and Hananiah the commander of the citadel were put in charge of Jerusalem. Hanani was a man of integrity and feared God more than most people do. 

+ God put it into Nehemiah's heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. 

+ The whole company numbered 42,360. 

+ The list of some heads of the families contributed to the work. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - To rebuild the wall, Nehemiah assembled the people to unify them and bought them to become one. We need to be aware that serving is not just to get things done, but to build relationships in constructing Christ's body. What can I learn from this? 

+ **Fidelity** - What was Nehemiah's criteria to put Hanani in charge? What can I learn from this?
