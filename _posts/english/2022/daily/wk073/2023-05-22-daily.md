### Question     
What did the prophet ask for from the Lord?

{%- include BibleLinks2022.html -%}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord has a case against His people: My people, what have I done to you? 

+ The Lord has shown you what is good. To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. 

+ Your tongues speak deceitfully, therefore, I have begun to destroy you. You will plant but not harvest. 

+ The prophet laments the righteous have been swept from the land, all hands are skilled in doing evil. 

+ The prophet watches in hope for the Lord, waits for God. 

+ Plead to God to shepherd His people. There's no one like God, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance and does not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. 

+ The Lord will again have compassion on us, will tread our sins underfoot, will be faithful to Jacob, and show love to Abraham. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - He has shown us what is good. To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with God. How shall I know God's will from His mercy and righteousness? How am I being humble in my service?
