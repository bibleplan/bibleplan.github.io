### Question     
What sin did David commit on the matter Bathsheba?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ David was going to show kindness to Hanun the new Ammonite king, but the envoy David sent was humiliated. Thus, the war between Israelites and the Ammonites began. Joab was fighting on the frontline and the ark was encamped, but David stayed behind in the palace. 

+ The army was fighting and yet David stayed in Jerusalem, saw Uriah's wife Bathsheba, and committed adultery. David called Uriah back as a failed attempt to cover up Bathsheba's pregnancy. Then, David used Joab and through the enemy's hands to kill Uriah. 

+ But the thing David had done displeased the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - While the army fought on the frontline and the ark encamped on the battlefield, David stayed behind and did the preposterous thing. What life's integrities can I see in Uriah from his answer to David? Much time had past from David first saw Bathsheba to when she became his wife. Why didn't David repent in such a long time? How am I being warned seeing David did not repent immediately even though he had a good relationship with God? Have I ever fallen into the depth of sin but never realized it? How is God reminding me?
