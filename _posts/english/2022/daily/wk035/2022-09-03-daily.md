### Question     
+ How did the Holy Spirit raise the first church? 

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Holy Spirit filled the apostles to enable them to speak in tongues of different native languages of the crowds declaring God's wonders. 

+ Peter addressed the crowds that Jesus is the Messiah. 

+ About three thousand heard and accepted his message were baptized and added to their number that day. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Would I feel being cut to the heart and come to God to ask for forgiveness if someone spoke of my past sins, whether intentionally or not? We all need someone who can point out our spiritual weaknesses. More importantly, we need to listen to Holy Spirit's guidance. 

+ **Fidelity** - Peter said: "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation." We would not turn a blind eye to the unbelievers if we understand from bottom of our hearts the corruptness. Do I truly understand the corrupt generation I'm in?
