### Question     
What life testimony did the Gentile Ruth live out?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ruth gleaned in the field for mother-in-law Naomi and herself and was protected by the gracious Boaz. 

+ Ruth was richly rewarded just as Boaz's blessing for her: "May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Ruth, a Gentile woman, her love for Naomi and faith for God became a great testimony to the Israelites. God's grace covered the Moabite woman Ruth aplenty even though the law dictates that the Moabites are not chosen as His. It is by God's election that changes our identity. What is my identity before and after I have come to know God? How do I identify myself and my value now? 

+ **Integrity** - What Boaz saw in Ruth was not lust but her faith in God. From what can I see Boaz's tenderness and respect toward Ruth? How should I view those who are in need?
