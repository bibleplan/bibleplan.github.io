### Question     
What were the ten commandments?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God gave Israelites the laws in chapters 5 to 11. 

+ God reiterates the ten commandments to the new generation of Israelites. The ten commandments are the essence of the law. The first four are about God, the last six are about people. 

+ Moses stressed "it was not with our ancestors that the Lord made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today." (Deu. 5:3) 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The Israelites feared God as they heard His voice in the fire. Jesus said: "because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." (John 20:29) Do I fear God from the bottom of my heart so that I would obey His law and bring blessings to myself and descendants?
