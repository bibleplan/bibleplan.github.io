### Question     
What did Moses plead desperately to Israelites?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Moses pleaded continuously to Israelites to obey God's law and pass on the obedience to their descendants so they may continue living on the promised land. 

+ Moses established three cities of refuge to the east of Jordan river for the two and half tribes. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - As a result of obeying God's law, will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people." Is my head knowledge of God's law real wisdom? Do I have the law embedded deep in my heart? 

+ **Walking with God** - God forbids idolatry because we believe what can be seen and ignore the unseen truth, way, and life. Do I believe my own eyes and what I see more than the unseen God?
