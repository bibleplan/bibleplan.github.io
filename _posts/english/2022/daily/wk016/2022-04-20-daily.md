### Question     
What happened after Joseph was sold to Egypt?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The story of Joseph after he was sold to Egypt. 

+ Joseph became a slave, was tempted, framed, and jailed. But God was with him the whole time. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Joseph prospered and succeeded in everything because God was by his side during difficult time. But this does not mean he would not be persecuted by the sinful world. Ask God to help me realize what is the real meaning of "Walking with God." 

+ **Integrity** - When faced temptations, Joseph tried to refuse and elude, but had to run away when he was unable to hide anymore. Joseph kept himself clean and had peace in his heart even though he was framed. What is my weakest point facing all the temptations of the world? What have I learned from Joseph's example?
