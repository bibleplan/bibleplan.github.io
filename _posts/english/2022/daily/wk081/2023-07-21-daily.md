### Question     
How did the Lord call the Judah to turn back to Him?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord told the Judah to "Reform your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place." 

+ The Lord would do to the promised land as what He did to Shiloh. 

+ This is the nation that has not obeyed the Lord its God or responded to correction. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips. 

+ The bones of the kings and all of Judah will be removed from their graves. They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens, they will not be gathered up or buried. 

+ The Lord says: "Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away? They cling to deceit; they refuse to return." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The Lord asked the people to deal with each other justly, do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow. Today, who among us are the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow?
