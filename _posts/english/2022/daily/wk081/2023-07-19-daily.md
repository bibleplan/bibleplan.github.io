### Question     
Why did the Lord punish Jerusalem?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The prophet questioned to the Lord: "How you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, 'You will have peace,' when the sword is at our throats!" 

+ The Lord said to Jerusalem: "Wash the evil from your heart and be saved. Your own conduct and actions have brought this on you. This is your punishment. How bitter it is!" 

+ The prophet was agonizing in his heart, which was pounding within him, and could not keep silent. 

+ The Lord questioned if there's one in Jerusalem who dealt honestly and sought the truth. 

+ Ravage, but do not destroy them completely, strip off only those do not belong to the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The Lord found no one in Jerusalem who dealt honestly or sought the truth, and those who swore, sworn falsely. How may I differentiate myself from the world but deal with honesty and mercy by following God's will?
