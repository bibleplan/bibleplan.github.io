### Question     
How did Israelites return to God?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After the faithless Israel committed adultery, her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. She also went out and committed adultery. 

+ The Lord called Israel to return, for He is faithful and will not be angry forever. 

+ Israel wept and pleaded, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the Lord their God. 

+ Israel come to God, because He is the Lord. 

+ If you, Israel, will return, then return to me and no longer go astray. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception. The Lord our God is the salvation. Where is my protection and help? Is it on the rock or sand?
