### Question     
How did Jerusalem experience the anger and fury of God's judgment?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jerusalem tells of God's fury in His judgment of the city and her people, He has shown no mercy to all. 

+ Jerusalem's prophets did not point out her sins, but said so many foolish things, false to the core, to put her into slavery. 

+ Jerusalem's enemies derided her and rejoiced over her suffering. 

+ Lift up your hands and cry to your God, pour out your hearts like water to the Lord. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Facing the consequences of sins, the prophet called upon the people to repent and cry out to God. What shall I do when I suffer in sins?
