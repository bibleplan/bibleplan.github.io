### Question     
Where to find hope in suffering?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jerusalem tells of her suffering as if she was in a dead end without hope. 

+ She found a ray of hope when thought of the Lord's endless compassion. 

+ It is good to both hope and wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord, examine ourselves, repent and turn again to the Lord, and lift our hearts and hands to him in heaven. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - One would find a ray of hope in suffering just by changing one's direction. I may find myself falling into a dead end of suffering. How shall I face that situation and find the heavenly hope?
