{%- include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future He will honor Galilee of the nations. 

+ For to us a child is born, to us a son is given. 

+ Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria are with pride and arrogance of heart. But the Lord has strengthened Rezin’s foes against them. 

+ The people have not returned to Him who struck them. By the wrath of the Lord Almighty the land will be scorched, disaster will come from afar. 

+ The Lord makes the Assyrian, the rod of His anger, the club of His wrath. The Lord Almighty, will send a wasting disease upon the sturdy Assyrian warriors. 

+ The survivors of Jacob will truly rely on the Lord. The burden of the Assyrians will be lifted from their shoulders. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – God disciplines the Israelites by His love. How do I understand His discipline? Do I truly know my identity as His child, as His beloved, and must be disciplined by Him?
