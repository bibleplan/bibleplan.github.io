### Question     
How will Israel end? 
{%- include BibleLinks2022.html 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Amos saw a basket of ripe fruit. The Lord said, the time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. 
+ Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land. 
+ I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight. I will turn your religious festivals into mourning and all your singing into weeping. 
+ I will send a famine through the land-a famine of hearing the words of the Lord. 
+ The Lord standing by the altar, and he said: Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword. 
+ The Lord will restore David's fallen shelter, so that they may possess all the nations that bear His name. 


### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - After judgment, the Lord will restore David's fallen shelter, repair its broken walls, restore its ruins, and rebuild it as it used to be. God's love to Israel is fully displayed here. It is not a hopeless destruction but a measured discipline. How does this promise help me to have total faith in Him?
