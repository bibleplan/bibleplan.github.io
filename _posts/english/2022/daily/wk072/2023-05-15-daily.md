### Question     
Why did Amos plead repeatedly for the Israelites to God?

{%- include BibleLinks2022.html -%}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord was preparing swarms of locusts to strip the land clean. Amos cried out to the Lord so He relented. 
+ The Lord was calling for judgment by fire. Amos begged to the Lord so He relented. 
+ The Lord was setting a plumb line among His people and He will spare them no longer. 
+ Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: Amos is raising a conspiracy against you. 
+ Amos answered Amaziah, I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but the Lord called me to prophesy to people of Israel. 
+ Amos prophesied against Amaziah that he would be punished. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Why did Amaziah sent a message to Jeroboam that Amos was raising a conspiracy? What can I learn from this when facing false claims against me?
