### Question     
What was the content of the new covenant?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The narrative of a new covenant from God. 

+ Aron announced the "festival to the Lord" with burnt and fellowship offerings during the Golden Calf incident (Exodus 32:5-6) As result, God reiterated the forbiddance on idol worshipping and obedience on festival celebrations. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God made new covenant with Israelites out of His love for them. Do I go back to God and ask for His forgiveness when I make mistakes? Do I reiterate my willingness to follow His steps? 

+ **Integrity** - God asked the Israelites to be faithful and not to worship false gods and idols like the Gentiles. There are different idols and false gods throughout history (money, power, success, games...)  What are my idols? How should I win over them?
