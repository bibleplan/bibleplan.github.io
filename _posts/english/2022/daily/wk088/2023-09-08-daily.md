### Question     
What four dreadful judgments was the Lord going to send?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ When any of the Israelites set up idols in their hearts, the Lord will answer them Himself in keeping with their great idolatry. 

+ The Lord warned the Israelites to turn from their idols and renounce all their detestable practices. 

+ If a country sins against the Lord, He will stretch out His hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it. 

+ Even if these three men-Noah, Daniel and Job-were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness. 

+ The Lord would send four dreadful judgments-sword and famine and wild beasts and plague-to kill its men and their animals. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Even the three righteous men could not save the Israelites from their sin. Today, only Jesus Christ can save our lives. Think about how God hates sin and how He loves His people. How may I have victory over my sin?
