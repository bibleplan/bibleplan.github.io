### Question     
How did the gospel spread to the Gentiles?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ By Jesus' name, Peter healed a paralyzed and raised a dead. 

+ Peter was led by the Holy Spirit to preach gospel to Cornelius, a Gentile. Holy Spirit poured onto the Gentiles for the first time. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Cornelius appeared to be a perfect man for he was devoting, God-fearing, gave generously to those in need, and prayed to God regularly. However perfect in our eyes, he still needed salvation from Jesus! We are often being self-righteous for our good conducts and become judgmental of others. Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to remind me, to show me the not-so-pretty side of myself. 

+ **Fidelity** - Jews consider the Gentiles as impure, unclean, and unworthy to be associated with. But, led by the Holy Spirit, Peter was willing to go into their house to preach gospel to them. Are there people around me need to hear the gospel? Pray and ask God to help me surrender myself, to rid of all my prejudices, to see their needs, and preach gospel to them.
