### Question     
How are we to rejoice always?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ We shall rejoice in the Lord always. 

+ Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present our requests to God. 

+ Paul was content in any and every situation for he leaned on the Lord for strength. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Paul rejoiced not because of the situations, rather it was his leaning on the Lord for strength. Am I rejoicing? Am I presenting my requests to God by prayer and petition with thanksgiving instead of relying on my own strength? 

+ **Fidelity** - Paul was content in any and every situation. Am I content when facing difficulties in my service? Why am I content or not content?
