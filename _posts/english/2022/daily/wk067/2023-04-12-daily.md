### Question     
How was the ark of the Lord's Covenant moved into the temple?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ King Solomon brought up the ark of the Lord's covenant from Zion, the City of David, to Jerusalem. 

+ While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them. 

+ Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands and prayed. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - In his prayer, Solomon emphasized that the temple is the temple for God's people's prayers. He asked God to listen to faithful prayers toward the temple. Is my church a church of prayers? How should I respond to prayer meetings? 

+ **Fidelity** - David and Solomon wished to build the temple and it was finally completed. How do their fear of God and heart of servitude inspire me?
