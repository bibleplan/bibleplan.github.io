### Question     
What were the duties of the Levites and the priests? What were they to receive from the offerings?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Verses 18:1-7 is the answer God gave to Aaron for the question the Israelites asked in 17:12-13. The priests and the Levites are to bear the anger from God so people won't die. Priesthood is a gift from God to the priests and also a gift to all people. 

+ God gave the Levites a tenth of the offerings the Israelites produced. The tenth of that was given to Aaron and the priests. 

+ Chapter 19 dealt with those who became unclean from the plague in chapter 16. Due to the large number of people affected, God gave them cleansing water to clean quickly and effectively. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Korah saw only the benefits but not the responsibilities. Do I look at my service to the Lord for my own glory or as God given responsibilities?
