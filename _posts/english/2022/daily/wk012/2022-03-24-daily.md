Why did Jesus ask Peter three times, "Do you love me?"
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus appeared again to His disciples by the Sea of Galilee. 

+ Jesus told them to throw their net on the right side of the boat and will find some fishes. 

+ When Peter heard Jesus, he wrapped his outer garment around him and jumped into the water. 

+ Jesus ate fish and bread with the disciples by the fire.  

+ This was now the third time Jesus appeared to His disciples after He was raised from the dead. 

+ Jesus asked Peter three times, "Do you love me?" and said to him, "Take care of my sheep." 

+ Jesus did many other things as well. Even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus let Peter go fish in the water when He first called him. Jesus strengthened Peter's faith again in the same way after He had risen from death. Why did Jesus do this? How my faith may be strengthened by going back to the original love of Christ?
