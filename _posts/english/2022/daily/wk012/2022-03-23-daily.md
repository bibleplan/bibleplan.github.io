### Question     
Who witnessed Jesus' resurrection? 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Early in the morning, Mary went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed and thought someone had taken the Lord out of the tomb. 

+ Mary saw Jesus at the tomb. 

+ In the evening, Jesus stood among the disciples and showed them His hands and side. 

+ Thomas did not see Jesus and asked to see the nail marks. Jesus came and let Thomas to touch Him. Thomas said to Him, "My Lord and my God!" 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - After seeing His wounds, Thomas declared Jesus is the Lord and God. Where does my faith come from? Where does my knowledge of God come from?
