### Question     
What comes to those who are humble and those who mock?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The pride of Ephraim is like the fading flower. 

+ In that day, the Lord Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of His people. 

+ The Lord lays a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic. 

+ The prophet reminds people to not mock, or their chains will become heavier. 

+ These people come near to the Lord with their mouth and honor Him with their lips, but their hearts are far from the Lord. Their worship of the Lord is based on merely human rules they have been taught. 

+ The humble will rejoice in the Lord; the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - In the last days, woe will come to those who hide their plans from the Lord. Am I walking in the light? 

+ **Identity** - In the last days, those who laugh and mock at the prophets will be rebuked by the Lord. Do I fear the Lord in my action and speech?
