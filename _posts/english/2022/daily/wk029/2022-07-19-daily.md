### Question     
What did Moses say about the rights of various people and marriage violations?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Verses 21:1 to 22:12 are regulations on unsolved murder, captive woman, firstborn, rebellious son, dead body on pole, stray animal, clothing as opposite sex (God hates sexual indistinction), mercy to animals, roof parapet, mixing of kinds (God dislikes disorder: Gen 1:4, 12, 21; Luke 16:13; 2 Corinthians 6:14-18), and tassels of the cloak. 

+ Verses 22:13 to 30 are about proof of virginity, adultery (exclude rape), forbid marrying father's wife. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - It can be seen clearly from the rights of captive woman and firstborn, and the lost things as well as the roof parapet that God wants us to treat others like ourselves and not take advantage of them. Have I recently forced others to follow my will? Atone to God for what I have done wrong.
