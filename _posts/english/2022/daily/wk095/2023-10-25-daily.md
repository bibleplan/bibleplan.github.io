### Question     
What was Zechariah's vision of the golden lampstand?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him. 

+ The Lord says, I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. 

+ Zechariah saw a solid gold lampstand and two olive trees by it. 

+ The lampstand is the Spirit of the Lord, the two olive trees are the two who are anointed to serve the Lord of all the earth. 

+ The flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide, is the curse that is going out over the whole land. 

+ The cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman. This is wickedness. 

+ Four chariots coming out from between two mountains-mountains of bronze. 

+ The Lord ordered a crown made of silver and gold to be set on the head of Joshua, to indicate the temple will be built. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord almighty says, not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit. Am I still leaning on my own might and power or the Spirit of the Lord Almighty?
