### Question     
What did the Lord say about the Mountains of Israel?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The prophet set his face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it, because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax. 

+ The prophet prophesy against the Mountains of Israel, because the enemies ravaged and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of people's malicious talk and slander. 

+ Mountains of Israel will produce branches and fruit for people of Israel. The Lord concerned for Israel and will look on with favor, it will be plowed and sown. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - The Mount Seir was punished because of their ancient hostility they delivered Israel over to the sword when they faced their punishment. How does God look at those who hold grudges against others? What warning does the punishment for Seir remind me of?
