### Question     
What was the Lamb doing on Mount Zion?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. 

+ They sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. 

+ Another angel was flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth. 

+ Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. 

+ The son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. He swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The son of man said blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. What is my perspective on life and death? What about blessing and suffering?
