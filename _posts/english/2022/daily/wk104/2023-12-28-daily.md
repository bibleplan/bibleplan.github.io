### Question     
What was the end of Babylon?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Another angel came down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. 

+ Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird. 

+ Come out of her, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues. 

+ Rejoice over her, you heavens! Rejoice, you people of God! Rejoice, apostles and prophets! For God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you. 

+ For true and just are God's judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants. 

+ For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Those who dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin! How do I see my wealth and status?
