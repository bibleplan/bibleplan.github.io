### Question     
What is the real gospel?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Paul's status and authority as an apostle came from God through Jesus Christ. 

+ False gospel from human is different from the true gospel which is from God. Preaching false gospel shall fall under God's curse. 

+ True gospel comes from God's revelation. True gospel is of righteousness through faith. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Preaching gospel and the truth is to win approval of human beings or God? Paul's dedication to gospel did not aim to please the other apostles. He went to Jerusalem to prove the gospel he preached was the true gospel. Have I withheld the truth when I preach because I was afraid to offend or I wanted to please the others? 

+ **Community** - Paul was accepted by all apostles not for his ability but for he preached the true gospel. Paul did not hold back to rebuke Peter because Peter had become an apostle before him. Both are examples of standing firm on the foundation of faith without taking something or someone by their face value. A relationship like this is one based on true faith and transparency. What does the apostles' testimony remind me? Have I taken anything or treated anyone by their face value?
