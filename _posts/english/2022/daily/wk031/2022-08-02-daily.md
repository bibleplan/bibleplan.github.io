### Question     
How did God help Israelites to capture the first city, Jericho?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The commander of the Lord's army came to Joshua indicated that God himself would fight for Israel. 

+ Israelite army marched around Jericho for seven days as God commanded. God gave the city to them. 

+ Contrast the sparing of Rahab and her family for their faith to Achan of the Judah tribe who lost everything because of greed. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Achan's greed angered God and brought trouble to Israelites. Have I been greedy and covet things that don't belong to me? Have I been hiding things that belong to the Lord? Pray and ask God to purify my heart to take greed away from me. 

+ **Fidelity** - Joshua led the Israelites to strictly follow God's command and God put Jericho into their hands. Do I follow God's command faithfully or take short cuts often?
