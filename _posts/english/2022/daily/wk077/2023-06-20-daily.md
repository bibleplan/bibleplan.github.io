### Question     
What should the Lord's chosen servant do?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord has already chosen His servant. He will bring justice to the nations. 

+ The Lord have called him in righteousness, to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles. 

+ Let them give glory to the Lord and proclaim his praise in the islands. 

+ You have seen many things, but you pay no attention; your ears are open, but you do not listen. 

+ Do not fear, for I have redeemed you. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me. I, even I, am the Lord, and apart from me there is no savior. 

+ Foretold the downfall of Babylon. 

+ The Lord is doing a new thing. 

+ I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord had said: "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze." I shall remember this fact and let it strengthen me in difficult times.
