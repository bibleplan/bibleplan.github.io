### Question     
Why did Judah king Jehoiakim burn Jeremiah's scroll?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord's word came to Jeremiah: "Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations." 

+ Jeremiah called Baruch to write all the words of the Lord on the scroll and read to the people. 

+ When Micaiah heard the words, he told everything he heard to all the officials. 

+ All the officials asked Baruch to read the scroll to them and told Baruch and Jeremiah to hide. 

+ The officials went to the king. Jehudi read the scroll to the king, the king had them cut off and threw into the fire. The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. 

+ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: "Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll." The Lord then added these about Judah king Jehoiakim: "I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - King Jehoiakim ordered the entire Judah to fast to repent and pray but burned Jeremiah's scroll. Are my actions and believe consistent? Am I willing to let God's word to reveal what's in the depth of my heart?
