### Question     
How did the Lord reaffirm His promise?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace, foretold that Hanamel would come and ask him to buy his field at Anathoth. 

+ Jeremiah took the deed of purchase-the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy-and gave this deed to Baruch. 

+ Jeremiah prayed to the Lord: "Nothing is too hard for you." 

+ The Lord will surely gather them from all the lands; he will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety. 

+ While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the Lord came to him a second time. 

+ In the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there will be heard once more the sounds of joy and gladness. 

+ The Lord declares: "The days are coming, when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jerusalem would bring the Lord renown, joy, praise, and honor before all nations and they will tremble for it. Has God already gained that glory? How may I glorify God?
