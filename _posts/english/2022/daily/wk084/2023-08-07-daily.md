### Question     
How did the Lord promise Israel's return?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: "The days are coming, when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity and restore them." 

+ The Lord declared: "In that day, I will break the yoke off their necks and they will serve the Lord their God." 

+ The Lord comforted Israel: "Do not be afraid, do not be dismayed." 

+ The Lord would restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents. He would punish all who oppress them. 

+ The Lord would be the God of all the families of Israel, and they would be His people. 

+ Hear the word of the Lord, you nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands. 

+ The days are coming when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What are the characteristics of the Lord's new covenant? Let me look in the New Testament to see how the prophesies are fulfilled: Acts 13:38-39; Romans 10:9-12; 2 Corinthians 3:6; 5:17; 1 Peter 2:10; 1 John 2:20, 27. What do these mean to me? 

+ **Integrity** - In that day, I will break the yoke of king of Babylon off their necks. Am I facing difficulties? How may I wait for that day quietly?
