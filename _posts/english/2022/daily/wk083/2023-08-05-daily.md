### Question     
What were the differences between Jeremiah's prophesy and other prophets'?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jeremiah sent letter from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, asked them to Pray to the Lord to seek the peace and prosperity of the city they were in exile. 

+ Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. 

+ When seventy years are completed for Babylon, the Lord will come to you and fulfill His good promise to bring you back to this place. 

+ The Lord said about Ahab and Zedekiah: "They are prophesying lies and will be delivered into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon." 

+ Shemaiah prophesied lies and would be punished. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Is it reasonable when the Lord told those who were in exile to pray for the city they were exiled in? What does this remind me of? How should I pray for the place and country I live in?
