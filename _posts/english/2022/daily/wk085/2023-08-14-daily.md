### Question     
Why did the remnant of Judah go to Egypt?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Johanan and all the people approached Jeremiah and said to him, "Pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do." 

+ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, "If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down." 

+ If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there, then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. 

+ Johanan and all the people accused Jeremiah of lying. So Johanan and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the Lord's command to stay in the land of Judah and entered Egypt. 

+ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon will come and attack Egypt." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - Everyone accused Jeremiah of lying and not delivering the Lord's message. Why? When I pray, do I listen only to the answer I want to hear just like those people?
