### Question     
What was the source of Babylon's destruction?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %}

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Babylon would be punished, captured, put to shame and Marduk would be filled with terror. 

+ The people of Israel and the people of Judah together would go in tears to seek the Lord their God. 

+ Announced once then again, the punishment of Babylon. 

+ The people of Israel were oppressed, and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go. 

+ A sword against the Babylonians, those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men! 

+ The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What is our responsibility when God's chosen people are being devoured? Take a look at verses 17 and 18. What shall I do when facing those who have sinned and those who deserve punishment?
