+ Song of Moses praised God for His glory, His majestic power, His win over the enemies, with His love, He redeemed His people. God reigns for ever and ever.

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Do I remember God and praise Him for everything He has done when I experience His blessings? 

+ **Community** - Moses, Miriam, and whole Israelites sang to praise God. Am I praising God with all of God's people?
