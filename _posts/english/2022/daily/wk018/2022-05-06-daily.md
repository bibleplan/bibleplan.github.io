### Question     
How did God supply the Israelites in the deserts?
{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ After bringing them out of Egypt, God supplied the Israelites for all their needs in the deserts. 

+ Israelites complained to Moses and Aaron for the lack of food and water. God supplied them with quail, manna, and water from the rock. 

+ God taught the Israelites to obey His commands and laws in addition to supplying their daily needs. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God tested the Israelites after they were brought out of Egypt to see if they would obey Him. When I follow God, I may be tested, too. What are my answers to His tests? 

+ **Integrity** - Whenever they are not fully satisfied with their material needs, the Israelites complained and forgot God's blessings and sovereignty. They experienced God's mighty power but could not remember His teachings and commands. Do I often complaint that God and His servants don't conform to my will?
