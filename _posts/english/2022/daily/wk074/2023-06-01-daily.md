### Question     
Why did Hosea marry a promiscuous woman named Gomer?

{% include BibleLinks2022.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Hosea married a promiscuous woman named Gomer, and she conceived and bore him a son called Jezreel. 
+ Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter named Lo-Ruhamah, for the Lord will no longer show love to Israel, that He should at all forgive them. 
+ Gomer had another son named Lo-Ammi, for Israelites are not God's people, and He is not their God. 
+ Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, they will be called children of the living God. 
+ Israelites are punished for their worship of adultery. 
+ After the punishment, God would allure, comfort, and betroth her to Himself forever. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God would betroth Israel to Himself forever, in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion. She would acknowledge the Lord. His righteousness, justice, love, and compassion form the foundation of our knowledge in the Lord. Do I know Him?
