### Question     
How does the fact that God is light take meaning in my life?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ From God is the eternal life, appeared through Jesus Christ to us, and that the apostles have seen and testify to it, so that we may make our joy complete. 

+ God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with Him, then we walk in the light, confess our sins, and ask God for forgiveness. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - We may live in the eternal life, so we need to hold fast to the truth and not in pursue of the worldly things as they are temporary. May I stay away from the life that pursues the worldly pleasure and fame? 

+ **Integrity** - We fellowship with God. God is light, so we need to walk in the light and sin no more. Reflect on my sins and pray to God right away to confess my sin and ask for forgiveness.
